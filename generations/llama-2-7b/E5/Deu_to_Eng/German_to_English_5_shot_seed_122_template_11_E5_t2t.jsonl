{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the super profits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}

{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by the underlying logic that is associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and two, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "You could say that the development of roads is inextricably linked to the car."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the medical field to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered to be more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time the title of the world's fashion capital also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally sourced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "In the past most farmers practised subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from the mainstream culture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographic in nature or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called \"wild\" or feral. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals, others lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child's behavior (within the limits of its physical abilities) is almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregivers, such as its fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project."}
{"translation": "Structures can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of structure, but also the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and should question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}

{"translation": "The use of video recordings has led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, which last only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of others."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if one does not do it: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest-to-access plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of targeted waking during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you're someone who wakes up to the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in body and mind."}

{"translation": "On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them, after they had violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for cargo transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The navy's traditional role was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring personnel and material over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep animals as pets so they could easily get their milk, fur, meat, and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep shepherds; often these shepherds were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the tram tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already quite early were sleepers introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails with a band of iron are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railroad tracks were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, didn't walk so upright."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If, however, you don't just want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed very much due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by John Hancock and Charles Thomson, the secretary of Congress, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it may not be possible to make a diagnosis right away."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medications or toxic household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both roaches and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their or their child's best interest to raise a child."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenting."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the observation of phenomena."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behaviors that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles for a while."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has and whether the cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to work, and are passed by others who have just left the same place to go to work."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system that is based on the private car, and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you'll rarely hear as many complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because one cannot predict driver behavior with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This allows them to have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, only dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun is at the center of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) moved around the earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, since it doesn't seem as if the Earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the second most water-rich river on Earth. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river."}

{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also proposed that they could change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}

{"translation": "People today write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a typewriter."}
{"translation": "You can be excited about what the keyboard will become when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About the same as when you roll a heavy car up a hill. If the nucleus is split again, part of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break down at the slightest or no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}

{"translation": "It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Maria, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what certain people are motivated to do, what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities, and taking employees to task."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"invisible team\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}

{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, such as traumas, injuries, and tumors, influence behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies allow us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This provides us with many information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads."}
{"translation": "AI is often associated with science fiction, but it is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "These things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems."}
{"translation": "Today's KI systems are often used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and they have also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technological solution. Students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Students are often a very critical audience, so the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces\" students to learn more about the world around them. The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and to express their own perspectives on certain topics.
