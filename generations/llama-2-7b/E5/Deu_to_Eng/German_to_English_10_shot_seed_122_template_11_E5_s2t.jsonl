{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical records and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states formed a weak central government based only on the Congress."}

{"translation": "Technically speaking, the so-called 35 mm format actually measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height."}

{"translation": "They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats at the King and Queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry mob turned the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified Queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has \u201ceffects\u201d on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of medicine to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shapes individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged that were related to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered to be more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally-grown seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "In the past most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries that is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from others can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style that includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are referred to as \"wild\" or \"feral.\" Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Others were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wilderness."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavioral patterns (within the limits of his or her physical abilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little clamp-man in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is designed to question, suggest, and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete on their own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the foster care system is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should cover all the needs that they didn't get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, learning and socialization are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"enduring relationships\" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle changes in facial expressions."}
{"translation": "In his article The President\u2019s Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still accurately judge the honesty of others."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, it has serious consequences if you don't do it: Growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of waking up intentionally during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you're the kind of person who wakes up in the middle of the night, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The less tension there is, the more positive the existing life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga."}

{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the clash of systems, the course of events, and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It should last for the next 40 years and in reality will be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them, after they had violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for cargo transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Traditionally, the navy's job was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to bring staff and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered over hills or other grazing areas. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, in England, they built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the tramways were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, railroad ties were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails, which have a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, didn't walk so uprightly."}
{"translation": "Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone bipedal as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If, however, you don't just want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It's really obvious that the world has changed dramatically due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many people don't consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it may not be possible to make a diagnosis right away."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container with medications or toxic household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both ravenous and bedbugs are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their or their child's best interest to raise a child."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenting."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often based on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, exhibit cyclical behaviours that are not just reactions to signals from external cycles."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute swinging cycles for a time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has and whether the cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on the private car, and support it."}
{"translation": "Now science is pointing out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you'll rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because we cannot predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities along the highway."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This allows them to have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, only dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun was in the center of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}

{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can be excited about what the keyboard will become when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About the same as when you roll a heavy truck up a hill. If the nucleus splits, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they will disintegrate at the slightest or even no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}

{"translation": "It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Marias, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what certain people are motivated to do, what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behavioural patterns can be observed when managers start to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to \u201cstay one of the guys\u201d (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and taking on employees."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual, who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for himself."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the drivers and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to whom every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time consuming process of implementing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}

{"translation": "It provides us with many information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "AI is often associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and time-plans, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "The KI system is today frequently used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military, and it has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technological solution. Students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to also learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract the interest of the audience inspires the students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and to express their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002)."}
