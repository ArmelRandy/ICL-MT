{"translation": "City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and an appropriate distribution."}
{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 federal states formed a weak central government based on the Federal Constitution, which consisted only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx."}
{"translation": "The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members."}
{"translation": "The \"Aufstrich\" symbol looks like a V and the \"Abstrich\" symbol looks like a square with a missing bottom line."}
{"translation": "Upwards means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downwards means that you should start at the frog (that is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "Generally speaking, stroking produces a softer sound, while scratching is more powerful and expressive."}
{"translation": "Feel free to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected."}
{"translation": "The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) as well as the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789."}
{"translation": "They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats at the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages."}
{"translation": "At some point a member of the angry mob turned the head of a king's guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of health care to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that forms individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of the fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally produced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from other subcultures can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical, or a combination of these."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style that includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to point to a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"feral.\" Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Others should have been raised by animals; some should have lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavior (within the limits of its physical abilities) that is almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregivers, such as its fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Structures can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of structure, but also the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should cover all needs that they did not get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"enduring relationships\" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, few milliseconds long facial movements."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The Speech of the President, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to a brain injury can still judge the honesty of people correctly."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet his needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you don't do it: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest-to-access plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of waking up deliberately during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you are someone who wakes up the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The less the tension is, the more positive the existing life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "In the center of Tibetan meditation stands the god-yoga. Through the visualization of different gods, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and in reality would be fought on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed completely and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Ukrainian and Belorussian fronts and created them, after they had violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring workforce and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that sheep were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep animals as pets in order to get easily at their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Even in the 16th century, England had built railway sidings."}
{"translation": "Although the inclined planes were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already quite early, wooden blocks were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails made of iron bands are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was customary, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so upright."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptomatic treatment. If you want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by the President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as \"Dunlap broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest known copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the passage of time."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adaptable at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease which affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the likelihood of women developing MS is twice as high as that of men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenting."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, which is a test to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of cyclical processes in the body and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behavioural patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known from most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles for a time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the relevant piece of genetic material has, and whether the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system that is based on the private car, and support it."}
{"translation": "The science now points out that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution in the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because we cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly described mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in planning, designing and operating facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This allows them to have a wider choice of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today only dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back."}
{"translation": "For thousands of years, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun was in the center of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, doesn't it, since it doesn't seem as if the earth moves, or?"}
{"translation": "Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "About 20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids out of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old."}
{"translation": "The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population."}

{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they are all found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "This more or less corresponds to the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, it also posits that they can change into new substances in order to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}
{"translation": "Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course there are other metals such as silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the pencil, after its invention, became a good friend to many people."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a typewriter."}
{"translation": "one should be curious about what will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "Much like rolling a heavy truck up a hill. If the nucleus is split, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest or even no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon is made out of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}

{"translation": "It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories concentrate on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what certain people are motivated to do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can be observed when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently from the team and takes everything for himself."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organisation take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organisation? The practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the collective work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Concept as a method to help organizations become more effective."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus they limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, such as trauma, injuries, and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "AI is often associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are control, the setting of strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "The KI system is today often used in the areas of economy, medicine, engineering and military and is also built into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can look at museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "A virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "As students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them\". The need to attract the interest of the public inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages learners to continue their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs \u201ecan enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of other people and to express their own perspectives on certain topics\u201c (Oravec, 2002)."}
