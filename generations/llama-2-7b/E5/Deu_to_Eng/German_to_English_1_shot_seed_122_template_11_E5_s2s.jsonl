{"translation": "City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and an appropriate distribution."}
{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "Technically speaking, the so-called 35 mm format actually measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height."}

{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry crowd turned the head of a killed royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "It can be said that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of cars also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally produced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to point to a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"These children are called \"wild\" or wild. Some wild children were held by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the significant intellectual or physical limitations of the child.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavior (within the limits of his physical abilities) that is almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference toward people."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Girders can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of girders, but also the little clamp man in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest, and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should cover all needs that they did not get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"continuing relationships\" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, few milliseconds long facial movements."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that one can recognize whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of others."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet his needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you don't do it: Growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest-to-access plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of waking up deliberately during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by the use of a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely."}
{"translation": "If you are a person who wakes up in the middle of the night, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in body and mind."}

{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}

{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring staff and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were already domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep animals as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Even in the 16th century, England had built railway sidings."}
{"translation": "Although the tram rails were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already quite early, sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it soon became clear that rails, which are supported by a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you want a permanent solution, we need to find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After its passage by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by the President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson draft was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, if you want to use computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Rove beetles as well as bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a child."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Certain behavioral patterns, which are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known from most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles for a time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the cells in question are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is in some way connected to a transport system that is based on the private car, and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately it is difficult to predict driver behaviour with 100% accuracy."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly described mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This gives them a wider range of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today only dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings."}
{"translation": "For thousands of years, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun was in the center of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem as if the earth moves, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the second most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}

{"translation": "The universe consists of its entirety of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to an envelope."}
{"translation": "One should be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}

{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Maria, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories concentrate on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what certain people are motivated to do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two types of behavior can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities and taking on employees."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the team leader and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the collective work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}

{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "AI is often associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are the ability to set goals, create strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions, and the ability to recognize handwriting, voice, and facial expressions."}
{"translation": "These things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems."}
{"translation": "The KI system is today often used in the areas of economy, medicine, engineering and military and is also built into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her pupils to places that cannot be reached by bus."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions represent a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits from the classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "A virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "As students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them\". The need to attract the interest of the public inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages learners to continue their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
