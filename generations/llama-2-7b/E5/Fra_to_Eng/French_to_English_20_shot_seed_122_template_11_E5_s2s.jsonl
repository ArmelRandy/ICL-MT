{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" resembles a V and the symbol \"pull\" resembles a staple or a square whose lower side is missing."}
{"translation": "High means you start by pushing the bow, and low means you start by pulling the bow."}
{"translation": "A bow up produces a softer sound, while a bow down is louder and more assertive."}
{"translation": "Do not hesitate to write your own marks with a pencil, but do not forget that the printed marks are done for musical reasons, and you should therefore respect them."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women."}

{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: The development of technology itself occurs beyond the influence of cultural and political forces, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, we could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the resulting injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped the individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His reputation as a center of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until around 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, primarily because the Crusaders were returning laden with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "Gothic architecture reached its apogee between the 10th\u201311th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "Initially, the robe was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication, Western modes could be accused of being 25 to 30 years behind."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and that is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender of the members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and argot."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or \"wild\". Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered from."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by non-human species, children raised in the wild exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical abilities) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little man trombone of Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult to manage for the student alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive, and educational, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care."}

{"translation": "Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and gratification."}

{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is also claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people unable to understand the speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in domesticated animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Twentieth century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal-origin foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way as chimpanzees do today."}
{"translation": "Interruption of sleep is the process that consists of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (10 to 60 minutes) later."}
{"translation": "This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biorythms include drinking a lot of liquids before bed (especially water or tea, which are reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}

{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by numerous Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the alliance between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles fought, through the use of proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers of the Red Army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.\n##"}
{"translation": "Using ships to transport cargo is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Traditionally, the work of navies has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the wagon ways were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accidental roads of the day."}
{"translation": "Crossties were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they were equipped with a steel strip on top."}
{"translation": "It has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of Australopithecus dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed dramatically due to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that problems have become more important due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}

{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap leaves that are known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}

{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Cockroaches, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are two times more likely to have multiple sclerosis than men."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt a baby for their child."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that eliminates one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but it also directs scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greek."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of functioning for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism appeals to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, especially the wildlife."}

{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on personal vehicles and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or bridge collapses."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) bandwidth, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with planning, designing, and operating roadways."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries eight times the volume of water of the second largest river."}

{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these are transformed into new substances to form what we see."}

{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There can be more maria on the side closer because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories are centered on the search for what makes people feel good or what attracts them."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature toward adulthood."}

{"translation": "Two theories of popular content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try and remain 'the good friend' (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything that the group has created up to that point and do things his or her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disputes between leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to respond to the needs of the client."}

{"translation": "The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to construct simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring intelligent approaches by machines."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into many home computer software and video games."}

{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience generally improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging 'requires students to better know the world around them.' The need to generate interest from the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used effectively, blogs can help students strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on well-defined topics (Oravec, 2002).\""}
