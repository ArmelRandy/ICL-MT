{"translation": "Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the scope of this worldly life. He was in the habit of visiting a cave on the mountain of Noor (light) for contemplation."}
{"translation": "The cave itself, which survived the era, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations."}
{"translation": "Situated at the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world."}
{"translation": "In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated."}
{"translation": "Above, one can only contemplate the clear and magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, one can only see or hear very little of this world."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today."}
{"translation": "Constructed by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs."}
{"translation": "The Giza Plateau, or 'Giza Necropolis', in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most impressive), several small tombs, numerous temples and the great Sphinx."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honour Kh\u00e9ops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and members of his family."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" resembles a V and the symbol \"pull\" resembles an agrafe or a square whose lower side is missing."}
{"translation": "The top means that you must begin by the point and push the bow, and the bottom means that you must begin by the hausse (which is the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "A bow going up produces a softer sound, while a bow going down is louder and more assertive."}
{"translation": "Don't hesitate to write your own marks in pencil, but don't forget that the marks of the bow are printed for a musical reason, and that you should therefore generally respect them."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame \u00c9lisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen had to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrorized queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large part of the expenses and interest payments on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages \u2013 the period of history in Europe running from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself goes beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive ownership of cars also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the physical injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His reputation as a centre of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until around 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders were returning with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th and 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At first, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication methods, Western modes could be delayed by 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, using seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by society and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of the members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered as \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered from."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by non-human species, children raised in the wild exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone of Microsoft Office is too."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an unstimulating, unattentive and uneducational environment, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a security zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and gratification."}
{"translation": "For example, \u00ab\u00a0learning\u00a0\u00bb and \u00ab\u00a0socialization\u00a0\u00bb are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal involvement\" and \"continuous relations\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to Internet sites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain lesions are nevertheless able to evaluate sincerity with great precision."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in domesticated dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variations expressed."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "Conversely, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large quantity of proteins containing all the vital amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way as the chimpanzees of the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process that consists of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (from 10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you have to reset the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The more the tension is low, the more the vital force is positive. Everyone has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies have become enemies and the Cold War has begun."}
{"translation": "It was to last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through the use of proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish pact of non-aggression, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "Shipping is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to send soldiers and equipment to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherd. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although wagon ways were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day."}
{"translation": "Cross-ties were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they were equipped with a rail on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\u201cupright man\u201d)."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a great deal thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more serious because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was then sent to a few streets away, to the printing house of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the \u201cDunlap Broadsides\u201d."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap copies that we know about are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists think today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Not many people consider them to be dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that are coded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduves, like bedbugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease which affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are two times more likely to have multiple sclerosis than men."}
{"translation": "\"A couple can very well think that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to take care of the education of a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt a baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or several possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to make observations, but it also orients scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of functioning for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They carried out two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulphur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, especially the wildlife and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, wildlife photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on site."}
{"translation": "We can, for example, go and see, photograph and discover the orang-outans of Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "The science now shows that this economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles in particular between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of circulation because the behavior of the conductors cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow rate, (2) the density and (3) the speed."}
{"translation": "These relations help in planning, designing and operating road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man called Aristarque affirmed that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth. It carries eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km in width."}
{"translation": "At least 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical excellence of their construction."}
{"translation": "The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which had then been around for more than a thousand years."}
{"translation": "The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated."}
{"translation": "The Vatican City State drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian."}
{"translation": "Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies."}
{"translation": "All citizens of the Vatican City are Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they occur in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these last ones transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two metals or more. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}
{"translation": "Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold."}
{"translation": "You can also find alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, like carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the appearance of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses."}

{"translation": "we can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next innovation arrives."}
{"translation": "The fission bomb works according to the following principle\u00a0: it transforms energy by assembling a myriad of protons and neutrons into a nucleus."}
{"translation": "A bit like if one were to climb a hill with a heavy cart. By dividing the nucleus again, and then releasing a little of this energy."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break down with little or no pressure."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon is made out of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Theories of content are centered on the search for what makes people feel good or what attracts them."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what pushes some people to want to do what they do and what pushes them to do or not do certain things in their environment."}
{"translation": "Two popular theories of content are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try and remain \"the good friend\" (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has difficulty taking unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, making evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his/her own way."}
{"translation": "In the end, the chef is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This kind of behavior often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the practice of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all the available resources are used efficiently in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can express themselves fully."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow the field of research to be reduced and made much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "We have known for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumors and traumas affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring an intelligent approach by machines."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the army, as it has been used in several home computer and video games software."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view ancient artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating in an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students to improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience generally improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
