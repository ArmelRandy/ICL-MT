{"translation": "When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if they migrate over a mountain range or across a river, or if they colonize a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before."}
{"translation": "This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor, rather than what it needed before."}
{"translation": "The original population has not changed at all. They still need the same adjustments as before."}
{"translation": "Over time, the new population adapts to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population."}

{"translation": "City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a lasting cultural footprint and appropriate distribution."}
{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government consisting only of the Congress."}
{"translation": "The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the state governments, which often did not cooperate."}
{"translation": "He also had no authority to suspend federal tax laws and tariffs between states."}
{"translation": "The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent."}

{"translation": "Technically speaking, the so-called 35 mm format actually measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height."}

{"translation": "Upwards means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downwards means that you should start at the bottom and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "Applying a thin layer of paint usually results in a softer sound, while applying a thick layer results in a more powerful and expressive sound."}
{"translation": "Feel free to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected."}
{"translation": "The panic-stricken King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on 6 October 1789."}
{"translation": "They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a shouting mob of people who were threatening the King and Queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry mob turned the head of a king\u2019s guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The US imperialists' war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S., in order to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and two, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time, the title of fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind those in the East due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture which aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method which uses saved, locally sourced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"feral\". Some feral children were held by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Others should have been raised by animals; some should have lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it has been completely reared by animals, the wild child shows behavioural patterns (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, for example its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is designed to question, suggest and explain tasks that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and educational, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should cover all the needs that they did not get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as between-person communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"continuing relationships\" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President\u2019s Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still accurately assess the honesty of others."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals like dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to cover its need for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if it is not done: Growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also contain large amounts of protein, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "sleep debt is the process of waking up deliberately during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you."}
{"translation": "If you are someone who wakes up to the alarm clock in the middle of the night, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the existing vitality. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been expanded by the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "In the centre of Tibetan meditation is the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualisation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It should last for the next 40 years and in reality will be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939 the Polish defence had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had violated the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The navy's role was traditionally to ensure that a country could continue to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran around 10,000 BCE."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep animals as pets for their milk, fur, meat, and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that wandered over hills or other grazing areas. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the trolley rails were made of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses to pull the wagons at higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, wooden sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails made of a band of iron are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common practice, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known form of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in an environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "That's often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the \"Dunlap broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Most computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects which are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenting."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to use the scientific method to discover how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It's not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behavioural patterns that are not just reactions to signals from external cycles are known for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can produce free-swinging cycles for a period of time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has and whether the cells in question are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system that is based on the private car and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at work here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it's hard to study traffic flows, because you can't predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This gives them a wider range of small hiding places, where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, since it doesn't seem as if the Earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Over 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or the technical perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old."}
{"translation": "The Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population."}
{"translation": "Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications."}
{"translation": "Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies."}
{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements like gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they are all found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, it also posited that they could change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}
{"translation": "Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are other metals such as silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole is made up of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the pencil after its invention became a good friend to many people."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to an envelope."}
{"translation": "We can be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About the same as if one were to roll a heavy wagon up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest or even no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side there could be more Marias, because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during the course of their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories deal with what certain people are motivated to do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognisable individual who has to do everything differently from the team that made it and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"invisible team\" is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the cooperative work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, it must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They thus limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of brain injuries such as trauma, injuries, and tumors influence behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "KI is often associated with Science Fiction, but is an important branch of computer science that deals with behaviour, learning and the adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour."}
{"translation": "Examples of this type of thinking are controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military, and they have also been incorporated into many software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technological solution. Students can view museum exhibits from their classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "As students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract an audience inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and express their own perspectives on certain topics. (Oravec, 2002)"}
