{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on 6 October 1789."}
{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who hurled threats at the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry mob turned the head of a slain royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by the underlying logic that is associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely beyond the influence of cultural or political forces, and two, that technology itself has \"effects\" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of medicine to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, which was drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged that were in harmony with this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were considered to be more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "During this time, the title of fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is farming that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method which uses saved, locally sourced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries that is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by society and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members from other subcultures."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from others can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through an unmistakable and symbolic style which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"feral\" or wild. Some feral children were held by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the significant intellectual or physical limitations of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavioral patterns (within the limits of his physical abilities) that are almost completely in accord with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp man in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is designed to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and educational, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the foster care system is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"enduring relationships\" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language due to a brain injury can still accurately assess the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like dogs."}
{"translation": "Studies in the 20th century have shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet his needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if it is not done: stunting, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also contain large amounts of protein, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you are the type of person who sets the alarm clock in the middle of the night, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the stress, the greater the available life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "At the centre of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. Through the visualisation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the clash of systems, the course of events, and the cultures led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It should last for the next 40 years and in reality will be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet soldiers of the Red Army invaded the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them, after they had violated the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for cargo transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The navy's traditional role was to ensure that a country could continue to transport people and goods, and at the same time hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring workforce and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats seem to have been domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 BCE."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate animals for their milk, fur, meat, and hides."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep herders; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the haulage tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, steps were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails made of iron bands are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the vehicles."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly."}
{"translation": "Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone bipedal as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in an environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It's really obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as \"Dunlap broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document took place by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is difficult to make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medicines or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can assume parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to discover how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "From a cycle, certain behavioural patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can even run free-swinging cycles in the absence of external signals."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marked a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected part of the genetic material has and whether the cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on the private automobile, and support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you will rarely hear as many complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it's hard to study traffic flows, because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to be somewhat consistent; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Velocity."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This way they have a wider choice of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, since it does not seem as if the Earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}

{"translation": "Whole 20% of the water that flows into the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 mi) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids out of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time."}

{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements like gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also proposed that they could change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}

{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "As a result, the pencil after its invention became a good friend to many people."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "People today write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new arrives."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About the same as if one were to roll a heavy truck up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest or no provocation."}
{"translation": "The moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side there could be more Marias, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}
{"translation": "These theories focus on what motivates certain people to do exactly what they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently from the team and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the collaborative work of an organization can lead to a new innovative way of addressing a customer need."}

{"translation": "It provides us with many information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "AI is often associated with Science Fiction, but is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour."}
{"translation": "Examples of this type of thinking are control, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military, and have also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technological solution. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract the audience's interest inspires the students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs \"can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of other authors and express their own perspectives on certain topics\" (Oravec, 2002)."}
