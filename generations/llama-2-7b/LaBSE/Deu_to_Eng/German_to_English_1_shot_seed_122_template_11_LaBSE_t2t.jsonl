{"translation": "The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before."}
{"translation": "With time, the new population adapts to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population."}

{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government consisting only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "Technically speaking, the so-called 35 mm format actually measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height."}

{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who threatened the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry crowd swung the head of a killed royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has \"effects\" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of medicine to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined over the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th and the 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind those in the East because of the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally produced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members from other subcultures."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from other subcultures can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to point to a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"These children are called \"wild\" or wild. Some wild children were held by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the significant intellectual or physical limitations of the child.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Others should have been raised by animals; some should have lived alone in the wilderness."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavior patterns (within the limits of his physical abilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, e.g. its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Girders can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of girding, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the foster care system is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should cover all needs that they did not get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as between-human communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal commitment\" and \"continuing relationships\" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings has led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting small changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like house dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savannah, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to cover its need for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if it is not done: Growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest-to-access plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also contain large amounts of protein, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "sleep deprivation is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you\u2019re the kind of person who sets the alarm clock in the middle of the night, you can put it on the other side of the room so you\u2019re forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive is the existing life energy. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "He should last for the next 40 years and in reality would be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939 the Polish defence had already collapsed and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganisation along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after they had violated the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring supplies and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran around 10,000 BCE."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Even in the 16th century, England had built railway sidings."}
{"translation": "Although the railway tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already quite early they introduced sleepers to secure the position of the rails. However, it became clear that rails, which are made of iron bands, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known form of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so upright."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases this is just a symptomatic treatment. If, however, you don't just want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by John Hancock and Charles Thomson, the president and secretary of Congress, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as \u201eDunlap broadsides\u201c."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest known copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the passage of time."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \u201ecrane fly\u201c is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the likelihood of MS in women is twice as high as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it's not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to use the scientific method to discover how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Certain behavioral patterns, which are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known to occur in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can even perform free-swinging cycles in the absence of external signals."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others who have just left the same workplace."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are somehow connected to a transport system based on the private car, and support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it's hard to study traffic flows, because you can't predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly described mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun is at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem as if the earth is moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Some 20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old."}
{"translation": "Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population."}

{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they are all found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "This more or less corresponds to the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, it also posits that they can change into new substances in order to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are other metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Consequently, the pencil, after its invention, became a good friend to many people."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and in its use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to an envelope."}
{"translation": "One can be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About as if one were rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest or no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side there could be more Maria, because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what makes certain people want to do exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, there are two behaviors that managers exhibit when they start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities and taking on employees."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum one becomes an unrecognizable individual that has to do everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the collective work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organisation can be innovative, the leadership needs to develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They thus limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, such as traumas, injuries and tumours, influence behaviour and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "KI (K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz) is often associated with Science Fiction, but is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and the adaptation of machines to intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "Today, KI systems are widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military, and have also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technological solution. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "As students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to inspire interest in the audience inspires the students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of other authors and express their own perspectives on certain topics.
