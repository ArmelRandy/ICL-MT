{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kh\u00e9ops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" resembles a V and the symbol \"pull\" resembles a hook or a square whose lower side is missing."}
{"translation": "The high sign means you must start by pushing the bow and the low sign means you must start by pulling the bow (which is where your hand holds the bow)."}
{"translation": "An arched bow tends to produce a softer sound, while an arched bow tends to produce a louder and more assertive sound."}
{"translation": "Don't hesitate to write your own marks in pencil, but don't forget that the marks of the bow are imprinted for a musical reason, and that you should therefore respect them."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame \u00c9lisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and threatening the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and the queen had to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrorized queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American government to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest payments on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages \u2013 the period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself proceeds beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, we could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive ownership of cars also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the physical injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until about 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, primarily because the Crusaders were returning home laden with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th\u201311th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At first, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication, the Western modes could be accused of a delay of 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest progresses of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a form of agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using seed varieties native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender of their members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by adopting a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability that the child had."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are entirely raised by non-human species, children raised in the wild exhibit behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project."}
{"translation": "Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little man trombone of Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult to manage for the student alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and including extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an unstimulating, unattentive and uneducational environment, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a zone of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the things that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification."}

{"translation": "\"Personal involvement\" and \"continuous relations\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that we can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in domestic dogs."}
{"translation": "Twentieth century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variations expressed."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two pools at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its needs for amino acids from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep interruption is the process which consists in waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (from 10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the alarm during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other options based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which are reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The more the tension is low, the more the vital force is positive. Each person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by numerous Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of various deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep differences between their different systems, methods and cultures put an end to the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It was to last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through the use of proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers of the Red Army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.\n##"}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them near them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks for wagons were simply made up of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The cruisers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a metal strip on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright with the arrival of Homo Erectus (the \"upright man\") two million years ago."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten document signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the \"Dunlap Broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap leaves that are known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists think today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Not many people consider them to be dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have feet covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medicines or household chemicals that are toxic."}
{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "The term comes from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduviid bugs, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis."}
{"translation": "A couple can very well believe that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to take care of the education of a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt a child."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but it also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators which will continue to function for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with a radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of activities on site."}

{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to a transportation system based on individual vehicles and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability which has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are the engineers of transportation simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relations help with planning, design and operation of road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "It gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries eight times the volume of water of the second largest river."}

{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these are transformed into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two metals or more. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}

{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "The theories of content are centered on the search for what makes people feel good or attracted."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what pushes some people to do what they do and what in their environment pushes them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two theories of popular content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try to remain \u201cthe good friend\u201d (or \u201cthe good girl\u201d)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything that the group has created so far and do things their own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the chef is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The 'invisible team' is the team of management to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the practice of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow the field of research to be reduced and made much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "We know for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumors, and traumatic brain injuries affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build models of simulation that help us to understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents an important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks that require an intelligent approach."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been used in many computer software and video games."}

{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view ancient artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating in a practical excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students to improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience generally improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"forces students to better know the world around them.\" The need to generate interest from the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs \"can help students strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by reacting actively to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on well-defined topics\" (Oravec, 2002).\""}
