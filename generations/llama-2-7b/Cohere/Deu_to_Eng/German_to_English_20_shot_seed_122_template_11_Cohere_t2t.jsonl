{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}

{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and two, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a few cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the medical field to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time the title of the world's fashion capital also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally-grown seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries that is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called \"feral\" or wild. Some feral children were held by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; others lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child's behavior (within the limits of his physical abilities) will be almost completely in accordance with those of his specific caregivers, such as their fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}

{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not get in the home from which they were taken out."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}

{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still accurately assess the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, it has serious consequences if one does not do it: Growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you're someone who wakes up in the middle of the night, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}

{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them, after they had violated the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for cargo transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Traditionally the navy's job was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to bring personnel and supplies over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as pets, to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered over hills or other pastures. They were tended by goat herders, just like the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the haulage tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already quite early, railroad ties were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, the realization set in that rails, which have a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright around two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly."}
{"translation": "Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone bipedal as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't just want temporary solutions, then we need to find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It's really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it may not be possible to make a diagnosis right away."}

{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both ravenous and bed bugs are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}

{"translation": "Studies have shown that the likelihood of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenting."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often based on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, exhibit cyclical behaviors that are not just reactions to signals from external cycles."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can run free-swinging cycles for a time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marked the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer."}

{"translation": "Now science is pointing out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you'll rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it's hard to study traffic flows because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities along the highway."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This way they have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun was at the center of the motions of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem as if the Earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}

{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behavioral tendencies can be seen when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities, and taking on employees."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are held to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"invisible team\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}

{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires the students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
