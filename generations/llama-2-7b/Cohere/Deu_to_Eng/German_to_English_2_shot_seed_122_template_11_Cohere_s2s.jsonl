{"translation": "If a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (e.g., if it crosses a mountain range or a river, or if it settles on a new island so that it cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before."}
{"translation": "This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so that the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor, rather than what it needed before."}
{"translation": "The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before."}
{"translation": "Over time, the new population adapts to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population."}
{"translation": "After thousands or even millions of years the two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species."}
{"translation": "We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution."}

{"translation": "On the back of the Declaration of Independence the words \"original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776\" were written. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document."}
{"translation": "Nobody knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29\u00be inches x 24\u00bd inches) was rolled up at the beginning of its life."}

{"translation": "The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which somehow defines the size of a society."}
{"translation": "City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate distribution."}
{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical records and fail to be recognized as civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}
{"translation": "The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the state governments, which often did not cooperate."}
{"translation": "He also did not have the authority to suspend federal tax laws and tariffs between states."}

{"translation": "It is still made today, but more important is that its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras."}
{"translation": "Technically speaking, the so-called 35 mm format actually measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height."}
{"translation": "The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2."}

{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}

{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely beyond the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has \u201ceffects\u201d on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "It can be said that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of medicine to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that formed individuals. With time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally produced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries that is still the case."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called \"feral\" or wild. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; others lived alone in the wild."}

{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet his needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, it has serious consequences if it is neglected: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also contain large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids."}

{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of waking up intentionally during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you are someone who wakes up the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in body and mind."}

{"translation": "The use of ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The navy's traditional role was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to prevent the enemy from transporting people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring supplies and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago."}

{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Even in the 16th century, people in England were building inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the tram rails were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to travel at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, wooden sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails made of a band of iron are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became customary, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}

{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering."}

{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like they did in the days of the dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Most computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is not possible to make a diagnosis immediately."}

{"translation": "Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a child."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "From a cycle, certain behavioral patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute swinging cycles for a while."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected part of the genetic material has and whether the cells in question are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}

{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict driver behavior with absolute certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently."}

{"translation": "In general, two behavioral tendencies can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities, and taking on employees."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}

{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}

{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \u201eforces the students to learn more about the world around them\u201c. The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
