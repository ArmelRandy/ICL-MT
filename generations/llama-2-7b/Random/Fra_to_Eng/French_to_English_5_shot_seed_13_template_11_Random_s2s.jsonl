{"translation": "Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the pharaohs who died."}
{"translation": "The Giza Plateau, or the Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, numerous temples and the Great Sphinx."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kh\u00e9ops, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" resembles a V and the symbol \"pull\" resembles a hook or a square whose lower side is missing."}
{"translation": "The high sign means that you must start by pushing the bow and the low sign means that you must start by pulling the bow (which is where your hand holds the bow)."}
{"translation": "An arched bow produces a softer sound, while a flat bow produces a louder sound."}
{"translation": "Don't hesitate to make your own marks with a pencil, but don't forget that the marks of the bow are imprinted for a musical reason, and you should therefore respect them."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis\u00a0XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to have their carriages' windows opened."}
{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrorized queen."}
{"translation": "American imperialism's war expenses in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American government to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages \u2013 the period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself goes beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned."}
{"translation": "For example, we could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "Massive car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the resulting injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His reputation as the center of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders were returning laden with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th\u201311th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "In the beginning, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication methods, Western modes could be accused of being 25 to 30 years behind."}
{"translation": "At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practised subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender of members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or savage. Some children who were abandoned by their parents (usually their own parents) did so because of the rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by nonhuman species, feral children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical abilities) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little man trombone of Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an unstimulating, unattentive, and uneducational environment, but that's the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a zone of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and gratification."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are considered to be major factors in Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal involvement\" and \"continuous relationships\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to Internet sites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in domesticated animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its needs for amino acids from the available vegetable resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal-origin foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way as the savanna chimpanzees do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep interruption is the process that consists of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (from 10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you wake up without fully waking up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself having to reset the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before bed (particularly water or tea, which are reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of various deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through the use of proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers of the Red Army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to send soldiers and equipment to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides."}
{"translation": "Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more common term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks for wagons were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day."}
{"translation": "Croissants were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a metal strip on top."}
{"translation": "It has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ('upright man')."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and disable it."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more serious due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten manuscript signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing house of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the \"Dunlap Broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to exist, they are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Few people consider them dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have legs covered with scales and equipped with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medications or household chemicals that are toxic."}
{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "The bedbugs, just like the bedbugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are two times more likely to have multiple sclerosis than men."}
{"translation": "A couple can very well decide that it's not in their interest, nor that of the child, to look after the education of a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "It is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that eliminates one or more possible hypotheses, asks questions, and makes observations, but it also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They carried out two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulphur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism appeals to people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, especially wildlife and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on site."}
{"translation": "You can, for example, go see, photograph, and discover the orangutans of Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down every day? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) throughput, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relations help with planning, design, and operation of road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "It gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth. It carries eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km in width."}
{"translation": "No less than 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects the water from thousands of small rivers."}

{"translation": "All citizens of the Vatican City are Catholic."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these were transformed into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two metals or more. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}

{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms."}

{"translation": "So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to less frequent uses."}
{"translation": "People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener."}
{"translation": "One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next innovation arrives."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a myriad of protons and neutrons into a single nucleus."}
{"translation": "It's as if we were climbing a hill with a heavy cart. By dividing the nucleus again and releasing a little of this energy."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on what makes people feel good or what attracts them."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what motivates some people to do what they do and what, in their environment, motivates them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try to remain \"the good friend\" (or \"the good friend\")."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his/her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the coach is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disputes between the management and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each member reports. They establish the standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to go through the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed."}
{"translation": "As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own learning culture."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow the field of research to be reduced and made much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "We know for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumors and traumatic brain injuries affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The advent of new technologies allows us to see and study previously unseen brain structures and processes."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build models of simulation that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring an intelligent approach."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer inquiries, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into many computer software and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can look at ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating in an excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet High School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, blogging \u00ab\u00a0forces students to better know the world around them. The need to attract the public's interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).'"}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs \"can help students strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by reacting actively to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on well-defined topics\" (Oravec, 2002).\""}
{"translation": "Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present."}
