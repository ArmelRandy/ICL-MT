{"translation": "In ancient China, there was a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a separate dynasty."}
{"translation": "Between each dynasty, there has also been an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty."}
{"translation": "During these periods, fierce battles took place between many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne."}

{"translation": "The cave itself, which has survived to the present day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations."}
{"translation": "Situated at the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world."}
{"translation": "In reality,\u00a0it's not easy at all to find,\u00a0even if we know that it exists.\u00a0When we entered the cave,\u00a0we were completely isolated."}
{"translation": "Above, one can contemplate nothing but the clear and magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From within the cave, one can see or hear very little of this world."}

{"translation": "The high means that you must start by the point and push the bow, and the low means that you must start by the hausse (which is the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "An arched bow produces a softer sound, while an arched bow produces a louder and more assertive sound."}
{"translation": "Do not hesitate to write your own marks in pencil, but do not forget that the marks of the bow are printed for a musical reason, and that you must therefore respect them."}

{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself takes place beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and technology has an impact on societies that is intrinsic rather than social."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}

{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important cultural determinant, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped the individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered as the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders were returning laden with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete."}

{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered as \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by non-human species, the wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone of Microsoft Office is too."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult to manage for the student alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, passing through extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a zone of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our placement system in foster care is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs in amino acids from the available vegetable resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, an absence of reaction has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, the food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors resolved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process that consists of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (from 10 to 60 minutes) soon after."}
{"translation": "This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you wake up without fully waking up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself having to reset the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The more the tension is low, the more the vital force is positive. Everyone has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by many Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of various deities that the channels of energy are cleaned, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies have become enemies and the Cold War has begun."}

{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}

{"translation": "Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherd. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the ways for wagons were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accidental roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbars were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. However, we soon realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a metal strip on top."}
{"translation": "This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "There are bipedal specializations in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten manuscript signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets away, at the printing house of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \u201cinsect\u201d is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}

{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "The science shows now that this economy massively based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability which has supported the human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate so much complaint, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range of coherence; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow rate, (2) the density and (3) the speed."}
{"translation": "These relations help with planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more efficiently food and mates."}

{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, peoples have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these last ones transform into new substances to form what we see."}

{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try to remain \"the good friend\" (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his/her own way."}
{"translation": "In the end, the chef is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team."}

{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the team of management to which each member reports. It establishes the standards for each of them."}
