{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kh\u00e9ops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and members of his family."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" resembles a V and the symbol \"pull\" resembles an agrafe or a square whose lower side is missing."}
{"translation": "The high sign means you must start by pushing the bow and the low sign means you must start by pulling the bow."}
{"translation": "A bow up produces a softer sound, while a bow down is louder and more assertive."}
{"translation": "Don't hesitate to write your own marks with a pencil, but don't forget that the marks of the bow are printed for a musical reason, and that you should therefore respect them."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of street vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen."}

{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the super profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism."}

{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself occurs beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "Massive car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the physical injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had an important cultural determinant, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a center of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until around 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, primarily due to the fact that the Crusaders were returning with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th\u201311th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "In the beginning, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communications, the Western modes could be accused of being 25 to 30 years behind."}
{"translation": "During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a type of agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, using seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender of members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or savage. Some feral children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by non-human species, feral children exhibit behaviours (within the limits of their physical abilities) that are almost identical to those of animals who have raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little man trombone in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage on his or her own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a zone of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the use and gratification approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are considered to be major factors that favor the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}

{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is said that one can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in domesticated animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the 20th century showed that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins with each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way as chimpanzees do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep interruption is the process that involves waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (10-60 minutes) afterwards."}
{"translation": "This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which are reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}

{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by numerous Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini (illumination energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep differences in their respective systems, methods, and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers of the Red Army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.\n##"}
{"translation": "The use of ships to transport cargo is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Traditionally, the work of the marines has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides."}
{"translation": "Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more common term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks for wagons were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day."}
{"translation": "Croissants were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a steel band on top."}
{"translation": "It became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more serious due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten manuscript signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, at the printing shop of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}

{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bedbugs, which are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Cockroaches, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are two times more likely to have multiple sclerosis than men."}
{"translation": "A couple can very well decide that it is not in their interest, nor that of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test which serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but which also directs scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greek."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only the mutations of germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism appeals to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, especially the wildlife and flora."}

{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation system, each person is essentially connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or bridge collapses."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed."}
{"translation": "These relations help with planning, design, and operation of road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly has allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "It gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarque claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?"}

{"translation": "All citizens of the Vatican City are Catholic."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these were transformed into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are primarily a mixture of two metals or more. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}

{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on what makes people feel good or attracted."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what motivates some people to do what they do and what, in their environment, motivates them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try to remain \"the good friend\" (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his/her way."}
{"translation": "After all, the coach is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behaviour often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \u201cinvisible team\u201d is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them."}

{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "We know for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumors and traumas affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The advent of new technologies allows us to see and study previously unseen brain structures and processes."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring an intelligent approach by machines."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into many computer software and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can look at ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating in a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students to improve their writing skills. Even though students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"requires students to better know the world around them\". The need to generate interest from the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs \"can help students strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by reacting actively to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on well-defined topics\" (Oravec, 2002).\""}
