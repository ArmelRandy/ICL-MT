{"translation": "Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the confines of this worldly life. He was accustomed to visiting a cave that became famous under the name of \u00ab Hira' \u00bb on the mountain of \u00ab Noor \u00bb (light) for contemplation."}
{"translation": "The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations."}
{"translation": "Situated at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world."}
{"translation": "In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated."}
{"translation": "Above, one can only contemplate the clear and magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this world."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today."}
{"translation": "Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honour of the pharaohs who died."}

{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Kh\u00e9ops, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and members of his family."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" resembles a V and the symbol \"pull\" resembles a hook or a square whose lower side is missing."}
{"translation": "The high sign means that you should start by pushing the bow and the low sign means that you should start by pulling the bow."}
{"translation": "A bow upward produces a softer sound, while a bow downward is louder and more assertive."}
{"translation": "Don't hesitate to write your own marks with a pencil, but don't forget that the marks of the bow are printed for a musical reason, and you should therefore respect them."}
{"translation": "On 6 October 1789, King Louis\u00a0XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame \u00c9lisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women."}

{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrorized queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the super profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism."}

{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself takes place beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "Massive car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the physical injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important cultural determinant, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until around 1100."}
{"translation": "Its status declined during the twelfth century, primarily because the Crusaders returned laden with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th and 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "In the beginning, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication, the Western modes could be accused of a delay of 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for clothing fasteners."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a type of agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Agriculture for subsistence is a simple system, often organic, using seed varieties native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by social norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of the members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered to be 'ferocious' or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by nonhuman species, feral children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical abilities) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supporters can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little man trombone of Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage on his own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a zone of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving carers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are considered as major factors favoring the use of Internet (James et al., 1995)."}

{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess the sincerity with great precision."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in domesticated animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two populations at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available vegetable resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal-origin foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in the same way as the savanna chimpanzees do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process that consists of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (from 10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself having to reset the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other options based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (particularly water or tea, reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The more the tension is low, the more the vital force present is positive. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of compassion and by many Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of various deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through the use of proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers of the Red Army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.\n##"}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the capacity to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's capacity to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most remarkable examples of this situation in recent times has been the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to send soldiers and equipment to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more common term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England since the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the wagon ways were simply made up of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day."}
{"translation": "Croissants were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a strip of iron on top."}
{"translation": "It has become a common practice, but the iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "There are bipedal specializations in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten manuscript signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets away, at the printing house of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that we know still exist, they are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds."}

{"translation": "They have legs covered with scales and equipped with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medicines or household chemicals that are toxic."}
{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduves, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men."}
{"translation": "A couple can very well decide that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to take care of the education of a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but it also directs scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greek."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism appeals to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, particularly the wildlife and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities."}

{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to their place of work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow rate, (2) the density and (3) the speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more efficiently food and mates."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "It gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?"}

{"translation": "All citizens of the Vatican City are Catholic."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "It was more a matter of the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these latter ones transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}

{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on what makes people feel good or attracted."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what motivates some people to want to do what they do and what, in their environment, motivates them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try to remain \"the good friend\" (or \"the good friend\")."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to that point and do things his/her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the chef is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disputes between managers and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organisation want to go through the tedious process of setting up a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process innovating to meet the needs of the client."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow the field of research to be reduced and made much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "We know for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumors and traumas affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our mind."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring intelligent approaches."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been implemented in several computer software and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can look at ancient objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating in an excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students to improve their writing skills. Even if students often try blogging with a careless grammar and spelling, the fact of having an audience generally improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
