{"translation": "The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789."}
{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry mob turned the head of a slain member of the royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The US imperialists' war expenses in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "You were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from the bonds flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}

{"translation": "The epoch in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 CE)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely beyond the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could argue that the development of roads is inextricably linked to the development of the automobile."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide network of roads for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of healthcare to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also shifted from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Farming for the market is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally produced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called \"wild\" or feral. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; others lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it is completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavioral patterns (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not have in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"continuous relationships\" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article \"The President's Speech\", Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of others."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if it is neglected: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep deprivation is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by the use of a relatively quiet alarm clock, to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you are the kind of person who turns on the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in body and mind."}

{"translation": "Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and enlightened consciousness arises."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course, and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "He should last for the next 40 years and in reality be fought out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939 the Polish defence had already collapsed and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet soldiers of the Red Army invaded the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them, after they had violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring workforce and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently already domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient civilisations and tribes began to keep animals as pets to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that wandered over hills or other grazing areas. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Even in the 16th century, England had built sidings."}
{"translation": "Although the waggons were pulled by horses on wooden rails, they were able to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, buffers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realised that rails with a band of iron are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was customary, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden axles of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you don't want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the print shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the \"Dunlap broadsides.\""}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which he read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the times."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitising humans."}
{"translation": "Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the likelihood of MS in women is twice as high as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the posing of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behavioural patterns that are not just reactions to external cycles are known for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, where they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others who have just left the same workplace."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic back-and-forth traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, and they support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately it is difficult to predict driver behaviour with absolute certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "That's why they have a wider choice of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, damselflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem as if the Earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and second-largest river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Altogether 20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids out of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old."}

{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, since these elements occur in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "This corresponded more to the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. He also posited that they could transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}

{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe consists in its entirety of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the pencil, after its invention, became a good friend to many people."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of new writing methods, so that it has lost its status and its use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can be excited about what will come out of the keyboard, when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About the same as if you roll a heavy truck up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy will be released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate even at low or no impact."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the sea and thicker on the land."}
{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Maria, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories concentrate on finding what moves people or appeals to them."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories deal with what makes certain people want to do exactly what they do and what influences in their environment make them do certain things or not do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behavioural patterns can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the boys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognisable individual who does everything differently from the team and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This kind of behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are run to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}

{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It is well known that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumour, influence behaviour and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This provides us with many resources and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is strongly associated with Science Fiction, it is an important branch of Computer Science that deals with behaviour, learning and the adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "These things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems."}
{"translation": "Today, the KI system is often used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from their classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Students are often a very critical audience, so the blog author tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract the public's interest inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and to express their own perspectives on certain themes.
