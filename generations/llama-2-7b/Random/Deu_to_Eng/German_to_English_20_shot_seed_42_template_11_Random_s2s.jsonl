{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members."}
{"translation": "The \"slash\" symbol looks like a V and the \"backslash\" symbol looks like a bracket with a missing bottom line."}
{"translation": "Upward means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downward means that you should start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "Stroking tends to produce a softer sound, while scratching is stronger and more expressive."}
{"translation": "Feel free to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected."}
{"translation": "In panic, King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789."}
{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry mob turned the head of a king's guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from loans flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and two, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is inextricably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a few cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the medical field to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 BCE and lasted until around 1100 CE."}
{"translation": "His status declined over the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th and the 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally-grown seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries, this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members from other subcultures."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called 'wild' or 'feral.' Some wild children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behaviours (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is meant to question, suggest, and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the foster care system is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not receive in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"continuing relationships\" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to a brain injury can still accurately judge the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation back and forth."}
{"translation": "Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if it is neglected: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep deprivation is the process of waking up deliberately during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you are someone who wakes up to the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the available life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course, and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It was expected to last for the next 40 years and would be fought on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans, however, were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet soldiers of the Red Army invaded the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after they violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy was traditionally to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport workforce and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Great Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 BCE."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as pets for easy access to their milk, fur, meat, and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the railroad tracks were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, buffers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails with a band of iron are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was customary, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"Upright Man\") two million years ago."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone bipedal as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "That's often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as \"Dunlap broadsides.\""}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on 8 July."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap broadsides that remain are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "You have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Most computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, when using computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately diagnose the problem."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to living in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt a baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenting."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often based on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "From a cycle, certain behavioural patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known to most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can produce free-swinging cycles."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on the private car, and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now points to the fact that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental at play?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because one cannot predict driver behavior with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities on the highway."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This gives them a wider range of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system's movements."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, since it doesn't seem as if the Earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Whole 20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6387 kilometers (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids out of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in the New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old."}
{"translation": "The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population."}

{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements like gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also proposed the theory that they could change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can expect to see something new from the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "Much like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. When the core is split, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they will disintegrate at the slightest or even no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is referred to as the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Marys, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories concentrate on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what makes certain people want to do exactly what they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory."}
{"translation": "In general, there are two behavioral tendencies when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and take everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behaviour often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the cooperative effort of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, it must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus they limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It is well known that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and tumour, influence behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies allow us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "It provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads."}
{"translation": "AI is often associated with Science Fiction, but is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and the adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that concentrate on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "Today, the KI system is often used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an important part of every school class. Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "It's also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces students to learn more about the world around them\". The need to attract an audience inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs \"can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and to express their own perspectives on certain topics\" (Oravec, 2002)."}
