{"translation": "City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a lasting cultural footprint, and an appropriate distribution."}
{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "The Cheops pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands."}
{"translation": "In the third century BCE, the Egyptians built the Cheops Pyramid, one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs."}
{"translation": "The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples, and the great Sphinx."}
{"translation": "The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members."}
{"translation": "The \"Aufstrich\" symbol looks like a V and the \"Abstrich\" symbol looks like a square, with the lower line missing."}
{"translation": "Upwards means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downwards means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "Stroking tends to produce a softer sound, while scratching is stronger and more expressive."}
{"translation": "You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected."}
{"translation": "The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on 6 October 1789."}
{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who hurled threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry mob turned the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human fate is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has \"effects\" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One can say that the development of roads is inevitably linked to the development of the automobile."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of medicine to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe in the Middle Ages."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began approximately around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until approximately 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined over the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th and the 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind those in the East by 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological form of agriculture that uses saved, locally produced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past most farmers practised subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members from other subcultures."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from the mainstream can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called 'wild' or 'feral'. Some feral children were captured by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have suffered massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wilderness."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavior (within the limits of its physical abilities) that is almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Ger\u00fcsts can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of Ger\u00fcst, but also the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educationally oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home is supposed to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which the patient was removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"continuous relationships\" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can nevertheless judge the honesty of people correctly."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like house dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation produces new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet his needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you don't do it: economic depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest-to-access plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us primates, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep deprivation is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up, without waking you up completely."}
{"translation": "If you're the kind of person who wakes others in the middle of the night, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room so that you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming estranged."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939 the Polish defence was already completely broken down and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were almost overnight obsolete, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine, creating them, after they violated the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties in the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to transport workforce and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were already domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as pets to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that wandered over hills or other grazing areas. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the sidings were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already quite early, thresholds were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails, which carry a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was customary, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of transportation was walking. Man began to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so upright."}
{"translation": "Two-footed species can be found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two feet seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his approval by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as \"Dunlap broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which he read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like they did in the days of the dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "You have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognisable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both ravenous and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the likelihood of MS in women is twice as high as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behavioural patterns that are not just reactions to signals from external cycles are known from many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles for a time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important indications that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the relevant piece of genetic material has, and whether the cells in question are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "An example of this is the visit, the photographing and the studying of orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are somehow connected to a transport system that is based on the private car, and support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points to the fact that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because you cannot predict driver behavior with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This gives them a wider choice of hiding places, where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "For thousands of years, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem as if the earth moves, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Some 20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}

{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "This more or less corresponds to the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also put forward the theory that they can change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}

{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe consists of matter in its entirety. All matter consists of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the pencil, after its invention, became a good friend to many people."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to the background, so that it has lost its status and its use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can only wait and see what will come out of the keyboard when something new arrives."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About as if one were rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. If the core is split, some of this energy will be released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate even at low or even no impact."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is referred to as the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side there could be more Maria, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories concentrate on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what makes certain people want to do exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment make them want to do certain things or not to do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behavioral patterns can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum one becomes an unrecognisable individual who has to do everything differently from the team and takes everything for itself."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams meet in different time zones that the local leadership may not have considered."}
{"translation": "The presence of a genuine \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the management team, to whom every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "If all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organisation, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the collective work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method of meeting customer needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus they limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and tumors, influence behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "It provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "KI (K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz) is often associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that concentrate on finding solutions for problems of real life."}
{"translation": "Today, the KI system is often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and military and is also embedded in numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits from their classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "As students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract an audience inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by reacting to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and express their own perspectives on certain topics."}
{"translation": "Ottawa is Canada's enchanting, bilingual capital and is distinguished by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present."}
