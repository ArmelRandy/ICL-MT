{"translation": "At some point a member of the angry crowd held up the head of a king's guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover most of the costs, and the interest from loans flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 CE)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and two, that technology itself has \"effects\" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is inextricably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the medical field to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as the center of luxury began around 400 B.C. and lasted until around 1100 A.D."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally adapted seed and combines it with intercropping or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries that is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}

{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from others can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical, or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called \"feral\" or wild. Some feral children were held by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; others lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it is completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavioral patterns (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp-man in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is designed to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete on his or her own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, and for reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the foster care system is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should be able to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal commitment\" and \"continuing relationships\" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to a brain injury can nevertheless correctly assess the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if it is not done: stagnation, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep deprivation is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10 \u2013 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you're the kind of person who sets the alarm clock in the middle of the night, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the greater the available life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the clash of systems, the course, and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It should last for the next 40 years and be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed and the only hope was in a retreat and regrouping along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans, however, were rendered almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after they had violated the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The navy's traditional role was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring manpower and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as pets for easy access to their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that wandered over hills or other grazing areas. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the tramway tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Even early on, rails were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails, which are made of a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you, however, want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "However, many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately diagnose the problem."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container of medication or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their or their child's interest to raise a child."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can assume parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to discover how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the posing of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific disciplines, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Certain behavioral patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known to be present in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that can even run uninterrupted cycles for a time in the absence of external signals."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marked a protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on the private automobile, and support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because one can not predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This allows them to have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Whole 20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids out of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or the technical perfection of their construction."}

{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements like gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since antiquity, as these can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, put forth the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also proposed the theory that they could change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}

{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole is made up of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}

{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of newer writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Today, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "One can look forward to what will come out of the keyboard when something new arrives."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "Much like rolling a heavy vehicle up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy will be released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they will decay at the slightest or no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}

{"translation": "It is thinner under the mare and thicker under the highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what makes certain people want to do exactly what they do, and what influences in their environment make them want to do certain things or not to do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behaviour often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, since their teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"invisible team\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "The collective effort of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to the development of a new innovative method of meeting customer needs."}

{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, such as traumas, injuries, and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "It provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads."}
{"translation": "Although KI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behaviour, learning and the adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer questions and complaints, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "Today, AI systems are often used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual field trips are a technological solution. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire works of art from their classroom."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \u201eforces the students to learn more about the world around them\u201c. The need to attract an audience inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day."}
