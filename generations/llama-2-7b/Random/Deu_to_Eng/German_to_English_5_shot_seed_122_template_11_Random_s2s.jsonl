{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which only consisted of the Congress."}

{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry mob turned the head of a killed royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from loans flowed through the banking houses of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}

{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside the influence of cultural or political forces, and two, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the development of roads is inextricably linked to the car."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the healthcare industry to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "In the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was slowly developing its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally grown seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by society, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called 'wild' or 'feral'. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the significant intellectual or physical limitations of the child.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wilderness."}

{"translation": "While project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is designed to question, suggest, and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}

{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to cover his need for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if it is neglected: stagnation, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also contain large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep deprivation is the process of waking up deliberately during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}

{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring personnel and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes started to keep them as pets to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built level crossings."}
{"translation": "Although the tram tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, rails were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails made of iron bands are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became common, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of transport was walking. Humans began to walk upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\") two million years ago."}

{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "That's often just like a symptomatic treatment. If, however, you don't want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}

{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their or their child's best interest to raise a child."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenting."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to discover how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific disciplines, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behavioural patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known to occur in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has and whether the cells in question are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "Science now points to the fact that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because we cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities along the highway."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "That way they have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today only dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, because it doesn't seem as if the Earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}

{"translation": "As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can only wait and see what will come out of the keyboard when something new arrives."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About as if one were rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. When the core is split, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break down at the slightest or even no provocation."}

{"translation": "On the moon's near side, there could be more Marys, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what makes certain people want to do exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment make them want to do certain things or not to do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual, who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for himself."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}

{"translation": "This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build models that help us understand the processes in our brains."}
{"translation": "Although KI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and the adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, the setting of strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}

{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract the public's interest inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
