{"translation": "The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations."}
{"translation": "The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world."}
{"translation": "Actually, it is not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated."}
{"translation": "He sees nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard."}

{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One can say that the automobile is unavoidable in the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of health care to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures developed with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily oktroyierte laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style slowly. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological form of agriculture that uses saved, locally produced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past most farmers practiced subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialisation is to refer to a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialised by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called \"wild\" or wild. Some wild children were captured by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have suffered massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Others should have been raised by animals; some should have lived alone in the wilderness."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, then the wild child shows behavioral patterns (within the limits of his physical abilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of his specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, the \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Ger\u00fcsts can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of Ger\u00fcst, but also the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and should question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}

{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to cover his need for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "In addition, it has serious consequences if one does not do it: Growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Waking up during sleep is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}

{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring workforce and material over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently already domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as pets to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "Sheep were normally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, in England, they built support tracks."}
{"translation": "Although the sidings were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already very early, steps were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails, which carry a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became customary, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known means of transportation was walking. Man began to walk two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means \u201eupright man\u201c)."}
{"translation": "Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so upright."}
{"translation": "Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two feet seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you only want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}

{"translation": "See on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both raids and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the dwelling of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the likelihood of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, which is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "From a cycle, certain behavioral patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known to most living beings, even bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles for a certain time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important indications that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has and whether the cells in question are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on the private car, and support it."}
{"translation": "The science now points out that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution in the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such conditions, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something fundamental going on here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, as drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better describe the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "By doing so, they have a wider choice of small hiding places in which they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings."}
{"translation": "For thousands of years, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the earth."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, since it does not occur to one that the earth moves, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}

{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behavioral patterns can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual, which has to do everything differently than the team did and takes everything for itself."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "You often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because your teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a genuine \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"invisible team\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}

{"translation": "New emerging technologies enable us to see certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "Although it is strongly associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI covers the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are control, the setting of strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and complaints, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition."}

{"translation": "The KI system is today often used in the areas of economy, medicine, engineering and military and is also integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to take her pupils to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. The students can look at museum exhibits from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "A virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a photo album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "The students are often a very critical audience, so the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
