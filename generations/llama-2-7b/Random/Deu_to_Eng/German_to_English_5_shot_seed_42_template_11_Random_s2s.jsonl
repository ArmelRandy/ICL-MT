{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}
{"translation": "The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the state governments to enforce its laws, which often did not cooperate."}

{"translation": "At some point, a member of the mob turned the head of a guardsman killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The US imperialists' war costs in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from loans flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}

{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by the underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and two, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the development of roads is inextricably linked to the development of the automobile."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the healthcare industry to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally adapted seed and combines it with intercropping or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries that is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}

{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from the mainstream can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographic in nature or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called 'wild' or 'feral'. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; others lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavior (within the limits of his physical abilities) that is almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete on his or her own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and education-oriented, but many are."}
{"translation": "For us the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}

{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of others."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you don't do it: economic depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also contain large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep deprivation is the process of waking up intentionally during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by the use of a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}

{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after they had violated the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The Navy's traditional role was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to impede the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring personnel and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Great Britain just as easily as the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently already domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as pets for easy access to their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the support tracks were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, buffers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails that carry a band of iron are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often."}
{"translation": "Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in an environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptomatic treatment. If you want a permanent solution, we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "However, many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Almost all computers in use today process information in the form of binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is difficult to make a diagnosis."}

{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitising humans."}
{"translation": "Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their or their child's interest to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenting."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to use the scientific method to discover how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behaviors that are part of a cycle are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, but are known to be part of the behavior of most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute swinging cycles for a while."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marked a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}

{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because you can't predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities on the highway."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This way they have a wider choice of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the solar system."}

{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}

{"translation": "As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Nowadays people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "You can look forward to what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}

{"translation": "Content theories focus on what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized over the course of their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories deal with what motivates certain people to do exactly what they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently from the team and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a genuine \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"invisible team\" is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}

{"translation": "Although KI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, the setting of strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems."}
{"translation": "Today, the KI system is often used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from their classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip, and to share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a photo album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \u201eforces the students to learn more about the world around them\u201c. The need to attract an audience inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
