{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear, without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected."}
{"translation": "In panic, King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789."}
{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point a member of the angry mob turned the head of a slain royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from loans flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and two, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a few cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the medical field to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally-grown seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries, this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be differentiated in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called \"wild\" or feral. Some feral children were held by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some may have been raised by animals; some may have lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavior (within the limits of his physical abilities) that is almost completely in accord with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference toward people."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp-man in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete on his own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and education-oriented, but many are."}
{"translation": "For us, the foster care system is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal commitment\" and \"continuing relationships\" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements that last only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article \"The President's Speech,\" Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still accurately judge the honesty of others."}
{"translation": "He even goes so far as to suggest that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like dogs."}
{"translation": "Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Outside in the savanna it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to cover his need for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences: stagnation, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also contain large amounts of protein that contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep deprivation is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you're the kind of person who sets the alarm clock in the middle of the night, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the available life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were almost obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by entering the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the Navy was traditionally to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to transport manpower and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, then Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain, just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient civilisations and tribes began to keep them as pets for easy access to their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were normally kept in herds that roamed over hills or other grazing areas.  They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built support tracks."}
{"translation": "Although the railway tracks were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Even early on, rails were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails made of iron bands are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known form of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\") two million years ago."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in an environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you don\u2019t want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the Dunlap broadsides."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive the times."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Almost all computers in use today process information in the form of binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, when using computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that one cannot immediately make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container of medication or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bedbugs and cockroaches are nidicol, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their or their child's best interest to raise a child."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenting."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It's not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test designed to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behaviors that are part of a cycle and are not just reactions to external cycles are known to occur in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marked a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the cells in question are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism draws people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on the private car, and support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities along the highway."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This allows them to have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and second-largest river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}

{"translation": "Whole 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids out of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their size or the technical perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old."}

{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements like gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. He also put forward the theory that they can transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can look forward to what will come out of the keyboard when something new arrives."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "Much like rolling a heavy vehicle up a hill. When the core is split, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they decay even at low or no stimulus."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the sea and thicker on the highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Marias, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during their adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories concern what motivates certain people to do exactly what they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behavioral patterns can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \"one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and take everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the drivers and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "The collective effort of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Concept as a method to help organizations become more effective."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus they limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumors, influence behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads."}
{"translation": "Although KI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behaviour, learning and the adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them\". The need to capture the interest of the public inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in relation to the texts of others and express their own perspectives on certain topics. (Oravec, 2002)"}
