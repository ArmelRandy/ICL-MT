{"translation": "This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it needed before."}
{"translation": "The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations."}
{"translation": "Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population."}
{"translation": "Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be considered members of the same species."}
{"translation": "We call this process \"speciation,\" which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution."}

{"translation": "Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, we know that at an early stage in its existence, the great parchment (which measures about 29 3/4 inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up."}

{"translation": "A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society."}
{"translation": "The word \"civilization\" is derived from the Latin word \"civilis\", which means civil and which is related to the Latin words \"civis\", which means citizen, and \"civitas\", which means large city or city-state and which indicates, in some sense, the size of the society to which it refers."}
{"translation": "City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilisation requires the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a long-lasting cultural imprint and an equitable diffusion."}
{"translation": "Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations."}

{"translation": "The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high, which is quite surprising."}
{"translation": "So we say that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest of whole number ratios) is 3:2."}

{"translation": "The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today."}
{"translation": "Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honour of the pharaohs who died."}
{"translation": "The Giza Plateau, or the Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Kh\u00e9ops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and members of his family."}
{"translation": "The symbol 'push' resembles a V and the symbol 'pull' resembles a missing lower corner of a square."}
{"translation": "The top means that you should start by pushing the bow and the bottom means that you should start by pulling the bow."}
{"translation": "A bow upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow downwards is louder and more assertive."}
{"translation": "Don't hesitate to write your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the marks of the bow are printed for a musical reason, and you should therefore respect them."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of street vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and the queen were forced, because of the crowd, to have their carriages' windows opened."}
{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American government to cover a large part of the expenses and interest payments on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the super profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages \u2013 the period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself proceeds beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive ownership of cars also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the physical injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had an important cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped the individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His reputation as the center of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until about 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders were returning laden with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "In the beginning, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, because of the slowness of communications, Western modes could be accused of being 25 to 30 years behind."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, using seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of the members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \u201cferocious\u201d or \u201cwild\u201d. Some children who are considered wild have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability that the child had."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by non-human species, children raised in the wild exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical abilities) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a way of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project."}
{"translation": "Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little man in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual ladders are integrated into the software and are intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage on his or her own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, including extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive, and educational, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a zone of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and gratification."}
{"translation": "For example, \u00ab\u00a0learning\u00a0\u00bb and \u00ab\u00a0socialisation\u00a0\u00bb are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal involvement\" and \"continuous relationships\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, has indicated how people who cannot understand the speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess the sincerity with great precision."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in domesticated animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variations expressed."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available vegetable resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process that consists of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (from 10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "It can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so you can wake up without fully waking up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which are reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his or her body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Everyone has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by many Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of various deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through the use of proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Traditionally, the work of navies has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to do the same."}
{"translation": "One of the most remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close by for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more common term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "The \u201cwagonways\u201d were built in England in the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although wagon ways were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull heavier loads at higher speeds than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day."}
{"translation": "Crossbars were introduced early on to keep the paths in place. However, it was soon realized that the paths would be more effective if they were equipped with a steel band on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten document signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the \u2018Dunlap Broadsides\u2019."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap copies that we know of are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Few people consider them to be dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medications or household chemicals that are toxic."}
{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduviids, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor that of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt a baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but it also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greek."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of functioning for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism appeals to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, particularly the wildlife and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of activities on site."}
{"translation": "You can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orang-outans of Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 per cent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonably coherent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the bandwidth, (2) the density and (3) the speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with planning, design and operation of roadway facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth. It carries eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km in width."}
{"translation": "Not less than 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical excellence of their construction."}
{"translation": "The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which had been around for more than 1000 years."}
{"translation": "The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated."}
{"translation": "The Vatican City writes its legislation and official communications in Italian."}
{"translation": "Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies."}
{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these are transformed into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two metals or more. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "So, the crayon was a good friend to many people when it was first introduced."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more private and less frequent use."}
{"translation": "People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener."}
{"translation": "We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next innovation arrives."}
{"translation": "The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a myriad of protons and neutrons into a nucleus."}
{"translation": "A bit like if you were to pull a heavy wagon up a hill. By dividing the nucleus again, and then releasing a little of this energy."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break down with little or no pressure."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the side closer to the sun because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on what makes people feel good or attracted."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what pushes some people to want to do what they do and what pushes them to do or not do certain things in their environment."}
{"translation": "Two theories of popular content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try to remain \u2018the good friend\u2019 (or \u2018the good friend\u2019)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his/her way."}
{"translation": "After all, the coach is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \u2018invisible team\u2019 (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \u2018invisible team\u2019 is the management team to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to go through the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the client."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They allow us to reduce the field of research and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "We have known for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumors and traumas affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The development of new technologies allows us to see and study previously unseen brain structures and processes."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks that require an intelligent approach."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as it has been used in many computer software and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can view ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating in an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students to improve their writing skills. Even though students often try blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience usually improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \u00ab\u00a0forces students to better know the world around them\u00a0\u00bb. The need to generate interest from the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs can help students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by responding actively to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on well-defined topics (Oravec, 2002).\""}
{"translation": "Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present."}
