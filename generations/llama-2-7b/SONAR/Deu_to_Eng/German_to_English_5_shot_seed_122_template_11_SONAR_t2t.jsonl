{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "Feel free to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected."}
{"translation": "The terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789."}
{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a shouting mob of people who hurled threats at the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry crowd turned the head of a slain royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest on loans flowed through the banking houses of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the super profits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history that lasted from 1000 to 1300 CE."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. One is that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and the other is that technology itself has \u201ceffects\u201d on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the development of roads is inextricably linked to the development of the automobile."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the healthcare industry to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shapes individuals. As time went on, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE."}
{"translation": "His status declined over the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of Fashion Capital of the World also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th and the 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture which aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally-grown seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from others can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical, or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"feral\". Some feral children were kept by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities."}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wilderness."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavioral patterns (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project."}
{"translation": "Structures can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of structure, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is designed to question, suggest, and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete on his or her own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and education-oriented, but many are."}
{"translation": "For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should cover all the needs that they did not get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as between-person communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \u201clearning\u201d and \u201csocialization\u201d are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\u201cPersonal engagement\u201d and \u201ccontinuous relationships\u201d were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the public\u2019s reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of micro-expressions, few milliseconds long facial movements."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that one can recognize whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still correctly assess the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even goes so far as to suggest that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet his needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "In addition, it has serious consequences if it is neglected: Growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for us primates unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also contain large amounts of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you."}
{"translation": "If you are the kind of person who turns on the alarm clock in the middle of the night, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a large amount of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been enriched by the path of compassion of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini Energy (Enlightenment Energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the clash of systems, the course of events, and the culture led to the countries becoming estranged."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It should last for the next 40 years and in reality will be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939 the Polish defence had already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had violated the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Traditionally, the navy's role was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring supplies and personnel across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 BCE."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep animals as pets for easy access to their milk, fur, meat, and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the railway tracks were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already quite early, railroad ties were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails, which are held by a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became customary, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Man began to walk upright with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\") two million years ago."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so upright."}
{"translation": "Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been bipedal seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in an environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "It's just a symptomatic treatment in many cases. If you don't want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "There are only 25 Dunlap broadsides left, which are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it may not be possible to make a diagnosis right away."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container with medications or household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very good at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can assume parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main aim of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "From a cycle, certain behavioural patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can run free-swinging cycles for a time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marked the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected part of the genetic material has and whether the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example is the visit, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system that is based on the private car, and they support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, as one cannot predict driver behavior with absolute certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "That way they have a wider choice of hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun was at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "That makes sense, because it doesn't seem as if the Earth is moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second longest and the second most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Whole 20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}

{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, it also posited that they could transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so small that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Nowadays people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About the same as if you roll a heavy wagon up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest or no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon is made out of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Marias, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what makes certain people want to do exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behavioural patterns can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \u201cone of the boys\u201d (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a genuine \u2018invisible team\u2019 (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively by all departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the collective work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method of meeting customer needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as a culture of shared knowledge and organizational learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Concept as a method to help organizations become more effective."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus they limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries such as trauma, injury and tumours influence behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies allow us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This provides us with many information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our brain."}
{"translation": "AI is often strongly associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are control, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been incorporated into many software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus."}
{"translation": "Virtual field trips are a technological solution. Students can view museum exhibits from their classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and express their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002)."}
{"translation": "Ottawa is Canada's enchanting, bilingual capital, and it features a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present."}
