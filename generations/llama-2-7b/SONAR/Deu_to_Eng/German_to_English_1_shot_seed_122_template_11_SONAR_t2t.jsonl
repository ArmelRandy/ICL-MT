{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry crowd turned the head of a killed royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that resulted from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you must first understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000 \u2013 1300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside the influence of cultural or political factors, and on the other hand, that technology itself has \"effects\" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "It can be said that the development of roads is inextricably linked to the development of the automobile."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the field of medicine to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, which was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shapes individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "His status declined over the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time the title of the fashion capital of the world was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and the 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind those in the East because of the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes as a result of the Crusades."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture which aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological form of agriculture that uses saved, locally produced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members from other subcultures."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from others can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "Children like these are called \"wild\" or \"feral\". Some feral children were kept by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Others were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wilderness."}
{"translation": "If it is completely reared by animals, the wild child shows behavioural patterns (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific carer, such as its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Structures can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of structure, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should be able to meet all the needs that they did not receive in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet connects both elements of mass communication, as well as between-human communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"enduring relationships\" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, a few milliseconds long facial movements."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to a brain injury can still judge the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet his needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if it is not done: Growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest-to-access plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It should not surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep counting is the process of waking up intentionally during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you."}
{"translation": "If you are someone who wakes up in the middle of the night and turns on the alarm clock, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The less the tension is, the more positive the existing life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "In the center of Tibetan meditation stands the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness arises."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It should last for the next 40 years and in reality be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939 the Polish defence had already collapsed completely and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans, however, became almost obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had violated the peace treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to prevent the enemy from transporting people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War. The Americans tried to bring supplies and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran around 10,000 BCE."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep animals as pets in order to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered over hills or other grazing grounds. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Even in the 16th century, England had built railway sidings."}
{"translation": "Although the inclined planes were made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, wooden sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails made of a band of iron are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became customary, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Man began to walk upright with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\") two million years ago."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so upright."}
{"translation": "Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two feet seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptomatic treatment. If, however, you don't just want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed very much because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his departure from the Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by the President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the \"Dunlap broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document took place in the Independence Hall courtyard on 8 July."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or poisonous household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both bed bugs and cockroaches are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenting."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works with the help of the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Certain behavioral patterns, which are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known to occur in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute swinging cycles for a time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the cells in question are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example of this is the visit, the photographing and the studying of orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on the private car, and support it."}
{"translation": "The science now points out that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution in the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in the society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, as drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly described mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "This way they have a wider choice of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun is at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem as if the earth is moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second longest and the second most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Twenty percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old."}
{"translation": "Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population."}

{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they are all found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "This more or less corresponds to the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, it also posits that they can change into new substances in order to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe consists of its entirety of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of new writing methods, so that it has lost its status and its use."}
{"translation": "Today people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to an envelope."}
{"translation": "One can be excited about what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About as if one rolls a heavy wagon up a hill. When the core is split, part of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at the slightest or no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon is made out of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side, there could be more Marias, because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories concentrate on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what makes certain people want to do exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do them."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain \u201cone of the guys\u201d (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities and taking on employees."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team has done and takes everything for itself."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the management team, to whom every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "If all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the collective work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Concept as a method to help organizations become more effective."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus they limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumour, influence behaviour and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This provides us with many information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "Although KI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and the intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this mindset are controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition."}
{"translation": "These things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to problems of real life."}
{"translation": "The KI system is today often used in the areas of economy, medicine, engineering and military and is also built into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to take her pupils to places that cannot be reached by bus."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits from their classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract the interest of the audience inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of other authors and express their own perspectives on certain topics.
