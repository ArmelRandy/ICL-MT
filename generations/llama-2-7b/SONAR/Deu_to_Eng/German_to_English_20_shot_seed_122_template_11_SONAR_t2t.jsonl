{"translation": "City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate distribution."}
{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical records and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government consisting only of the Congress."}
{"translation": "The Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the state governments to enforce all its laws, which often did not cooperate."}
{"translation": "He also did not have the authority to suspend federal tax laws and tariffs between states."}

{"translation": "Feel free to add your own pencil markings; just remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected."}
{"translation": "The panic-stricken King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789."}
{"translation": "They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the enraged crowd turned the head of a slain royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and interest payments on loans flowed through the banking houses of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the super profits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the fundamental gains of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a time in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 CE)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology-push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a fundamental logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. One, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and two, that technology itself has \"effects\" on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the health care industry to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of romanticism, it is geography that shapes individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged that were in harmony with this geography and these, because they were in accord with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time, the title of Fashion Capital of the World also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communications channels."}
{"translation": "Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture which aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method which uses saved, locally sourced seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "In the past most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members from other subcultures."}
{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographic in nature, or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits, and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or feral. Some feral children were held by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities."}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Others were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child's behavior (within the limits of its physical abilities) is almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support for individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp-man in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is designed to question, suggest, and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the foster care system is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should cover all needs that they did not get in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication, as well as interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \u2018learning\u2019 and \u2018socialisation\u2019 are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"enduring relationships\" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle changes in facial expressions."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still accurately judge the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation produces new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet his needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "In addition, it has serious consequences if it is not done: Growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us if our ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10\u201360 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you are the kind of person who sets the alarm clock in the middle of the night, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a large amount of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in the body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the greater the available life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been expanded by the path of love of the Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini Energy (Enlightenment Energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and in reality would be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union poured into the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them, after they had violated the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Traditionally, the navy's job was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to get supplies and personnel over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as pets, to easily get their milk, fur, meat, and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep shepherds; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "By the 16th century, England had already built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the railway tracks were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails, which have a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron railroad tracks were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often."}
{"translation": "Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone bipedal as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in an environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't just want temporary solutions, then we need to find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as \"Dunlap broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides still in existence, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it may not be possible to make a diagnosis right away."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by ingestion is the presence of an open container with medicines or toxic household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both ravenous and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide to adopt a child."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, so that another couple can assume the parenting role."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "It is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often based on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "From a cycle, certain behavioural patterns, which are not only reactions to signals from external cycles, are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, where they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has and whether the cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem."}
{"translation": "An example of this is the visiting, photographing and studying of orangutans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system that is based on the private car, and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, as one cannot predict driver behavior with 100-percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This way they have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, since it doesn't seem as if the Earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide."}
{"translation": "Whole 20 percent of the water that flows over the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the building of pyramids out of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction."}
{"translation": "Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old."}
{"translation": "The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population."}

{"translation": "All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic."}
{"translation": "Fundamental chemical elements like gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and can be extracted with primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "This more closely resembled the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. He also proposed that they could change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit in the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background with the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Nowadays people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "Much like rolling a heavy truck up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they will disintegrate at the slightest or no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side there could be more Marias, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what certain people are motivated to do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This type of behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \u2018invisible team\u2019 (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \u201cinvisible team\u201d is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively by all departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge."}
{"translation": "In the end, the collective work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}

{"translation": "Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more performance-oriented."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus they limit the research area and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries such as trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies allow us to see certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This provides us with many information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads."}
{"translation": "AI is often associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of this type of thinking include controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been incorporated into many software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option."}
{"translation": "Virtual field trips are a technological solution. Students can view museum exhibits from their classroom, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Because students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract an audience inspires students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs \"can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and express their own perspectives on certain topics\" (Oravec, 2002)."}
{"translation": "Ottawa is Canada's enchanting, bilingual capital, and features a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present."}

{"translation": "All these things and more make Ontario what is considered typical Canadian by outsiders."}
{"translation": "Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness."}

{"translation": "The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa."}
{"translation": "Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, a separate continent."}
