{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical records and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "At some point, a member of the angry mob turned the head of a slain royal guard in front of the horrified queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from loans flowed through the banking houses of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the founding of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 n. Chr.)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by the underlying logic that is associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology follows a path that is largely outside of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidable in the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies in the healthcare industry to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shapes individuals. As time went on, customs and cultures emerged with reference to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His fame as a center of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time, the title of fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and the 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West lag behind by 25 to 30 years due to the slow communication channels."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally-grown seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries that is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}

{"translation": "The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from others can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical, or a combination of these factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style that includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"feral\" or wild. Some feral children were held by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Others were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavioral patterns (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, the \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp-man in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest, and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete on his or her own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home should be able to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal engagement\" and \"continuous relationships\" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the audience's reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to speak due to a brain injury can still accurately judge the honesty of people."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human's to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you don't do it: Growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also contain large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us that our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep tracking is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you are someone who wakes up in the middle of the night and turns on the alarm clock, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another option based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}

{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course of events, and the culture led to the countries becoming enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and would be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them, after they had violated the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by entering the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The navy's traditional role was to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War. The Americans were trying to bring supplies and materials over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 BCE."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep animals as pets for easy access to their milk, fur, meat, and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just as with sheep; often it was children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the railroad tracks were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Early on, sleepers were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, it was soon realized that rails, which carry a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became common practice, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so upright."}
{"translation": "Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone bipedal as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If, however, you don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}

{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten document has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Nearly all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is difficult to make a diagnosis."}

{"translation": "Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"bug\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both ravenous and bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or home of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of working age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can assume parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It's not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test to exclude one or more hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the asking of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behavioural patterns that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known to most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can still perform free-swinging cycles."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have different effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has, and whether the cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, and they support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, as one cannot predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities along the highway."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This allows them to have a wider range of small hiding places where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun is at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system including the Sun (and even the other stars) revolved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, doesn't it, since it doesn't seem as if the earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}

{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four states of aggregation (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also proposed that they could change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}

{"translation": "Nowadays people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "One can be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new arrives."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About the same as when you roll a heavy vehicle up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy is released."}

{"translation": "It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands."}
{"translation": "On the near side there could be more Marias, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}
{"translation": "These theories are concerned with what certain people are motivated to do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do certain things or not to do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behavioral patterns can be observed when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are managed according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"\"invisible team\"\" is the leadership team, to whom every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for every member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}

{"translation": "This provides us with many information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, but it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behaviour, learning and adaptation of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples of these skills are controlling, setting up strategies and time plans, the ability to answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been incorporated into many software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places that can't be reached by bus."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technological solution. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Students are often a very critical audience, so the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract the interest of the public inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside of the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active reaction to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and express their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002)."}
