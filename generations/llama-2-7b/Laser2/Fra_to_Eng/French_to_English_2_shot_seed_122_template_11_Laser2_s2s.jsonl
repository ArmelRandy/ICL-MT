{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honour Kh\u00e9ops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and members of his family."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" resembles a V and the symbol \"pull\" resembles a missing lower corner of a square."}
{"translation": "The high sign means you should start by pushing the bow and the low sign means you should start by pulling the bow (which is where your hand holds the bow)."}
{"translation": "An arched bow produces a softer sound, while a flat bow produces a louder sound."}
{"translation": "Don't hesitate to write your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the marks of the bow are printed for a musical reason, and you should therefore respect them."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis\u00a0XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and threatening the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen had to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd."}
{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrorized queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages \u2013 the period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself proceeds beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, we could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "Massive car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat the resulting injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His reputation as the center of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until about 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned laden with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "Gothic architecture reached its apogee between the 10th\u201311th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At first, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication, Western modes could be accused of being 25 to 30 years behind."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, using original seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and it is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender of their members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered as \u00ab ferocious \u00bb or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered from."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by non-human species, feral children exhibit behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little man trombone of Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual ladders are integrated into the software and are designed to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage on his or her own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, passing through extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, attentive and educational, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and gratification."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal involvement\" and \"continuous relations\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who can not understand the speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess the sincerity with great precision."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in domesticated animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available vegetable resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way as the savanna chimpanzees do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep interruption is the process that consists of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you have to reset the alarm clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, which are reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of compassion and by numerous Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "Using ships to transport cargo is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them near them to have easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more common term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the wagon ways were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The cruisers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a metal strip on top."}
{"translation": "It has become a common practice, but iron wheels caused more wear on wooden wagon wheels."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (the \"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and disable it."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on the 4th of July, a handwritten manuscript signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets away, to the printing house of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as Dunlap Broadsides."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtroom on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap copies that we know of are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists think today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Few people consider them to be dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are lots of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Reduces, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to take care of the education of a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples may choose to adopt a child."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and experience is a test that eliminates one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but it also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, particularly the wildlife and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on site."}
{"translation": "You can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orang-outans of Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that had supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are the engineers of transportation simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow rate, (2) the density, and (3) the speed."}
{"translation": "These relations help with planning, design and operation of road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "It gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km in width."}
{"translation": "At least 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers."}

{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, people have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two metals or more. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}
{"translation": "Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the appearance of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses."}
{"translation": "People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener."}
{"translation": "One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next innovation arrives."}
{"translation": "The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a myriad of protons and neutrons into a nucleus."}
{"translation": "As if we were pulling a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the nucleus again and releasing a little of this energy."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so that they tend to break up with little or no pressure."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on what makes people feel good or what attracts them."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they matured into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what pushes certain people to do the things they do and what in their environment pushes them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular theories of content are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try and remain \"the good friend\" (or \"the good friend\")."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things their way."}
{"translation": "After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The 'invisible team' is the team of management to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to respond to the customer need."}
{"translation": "Before an organisation can be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow the field of research to be reduced and made much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "We know for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumours and traumatic brain injuries affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before."}
{"translation": "This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks that require an intelligent approach."}
{"translation": "Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been used in several computer software and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can look at ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Taking part in a practical excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students to improve their writing skills. Even though students often try blogging with a careless grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience generally improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"requires students to better know the world around them\". The need to attract the attention of the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs \"can help students strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by reacting actively to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own points of view on well-defined topics\" (Oravec, 2002).\""}
{"translation": "Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present."}
