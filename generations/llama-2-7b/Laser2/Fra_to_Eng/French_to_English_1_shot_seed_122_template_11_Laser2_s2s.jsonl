{"translation": "This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it needed before."}

{"translation": "In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated."}
{"translation": "Above, one can only contemplate the clear and magnificent sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, one can see or hear very little of this world."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists."}
{"translation": "Constructed by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs."}
{"translation": "The plateau of Giza, or \u00ab\u2009Giza Necropolis\u2009\u00bb, in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, gathers several pyramids (the largest pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, numerous temples and the great Sphinx."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honour Kh\u00e9ops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour his wives and members of his family."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" resembles a V and the symbol \"pull\" resembles a hook or a square whose lower side is missing."}
{"translation": "High means that you must start with the point and push the bow, and low means that you must start with the haul (which is the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "A bow drawn upwards produces a softer sound, while a bow drawn downwards is louder and more assertive."}
{"translation": "Don't hesitate to write your own marks in pencil, but don't forget that the marks of the bow are printed for a musical reason, and that you should therefore respect them."}
{"translation": "On the 6th of October 1789, the King Louis\u00a0XVI, the Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11\u00a0years old, and Louis-Charles, 4\u00a0years old) and the sister of the King, madame \u00c9lisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and making threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen had to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd."}
{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrorized queen."}
{"translation": "American imperialism's war expenditures in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages \u2013 the period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the development of technology itself proceeds beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and technology has an impact on societies that is intrinsic rather than social."}
{"translation": "For example, we could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "Massive car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat body injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important cultural determinant, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a center of luxury began around the year 400 and lasted until about 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders were returning laden with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries."}
{"translation": "At first, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, the Western modes could be accused of a delay of 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a type of agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, using original seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by social norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of the members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered as \u00ab ferocious \u00bb or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away."}
{"translation": "Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature."}
{"translation": "When they are fully raised by non-human species, feral children show almost the same behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) as the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supporters can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man with the trombone of Microsoft Office is too."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, passing through extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an unstimulating, unattentive and uneducational environment, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "Placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and gratifications."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are considered as major factors favoring the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal involvement\" and \"continuous relations\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that we can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who can not understand the speech due to brain damage are still able to evaluate the sincerity with great precision."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in domestic dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variations expressed."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available vegetable resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, an absence of reaction has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible vegetable resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in much the same way as the savannah chimps do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep interruption is the process that consists of waking up intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep again (within 10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself having to reset the alarm clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biorythme include drinking a lot of liquids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, which are reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Everyone has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "The centre of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualisation of different deities that the channels of energy are cleansed, the chakras activated, and enlightenment consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through the use of proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish pact of non-aggression, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "Shipping is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most remarkable examples of this situation in recent times has been the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean to send soldiers and equipment to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them near them to have easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although wagon ways were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more accident-prone roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The cruisers were introduced early on to keep the runways in place. However, it was soon realized that the runways would be more effective if they were equipped with a strip of iron on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\u201cupright man\u201d)."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopiths, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress made by humans, and that the problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten manuscript signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets away, at the printing house of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as the Dunlap Broadsides."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap broadsides of which we still know the existence are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists think today that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Not many people consider them to be dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in the form of binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits for computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term 'insect' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduves, like bedbugs, are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are two times more likely to have multiple sclerosis than men."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to take care of the education of a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples may choose to adopt a child."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but it also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "The naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on the ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They carried out two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulphur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can cause the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, particularly the wildlife and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of activities on site."}
{"translation": "You can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orang-outans of Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are the engineers of transportation simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the volume, (2) the density and (3) the speed."}
{"translation": "These relations help with planning, design and operation of road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body."}
{"translation": "It gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarque claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, doesn't it, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km in width."}
{"translation": "At least 20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects the water from thousands of small rivers."}
{"translation": "Although the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence."}
{"translation": "The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which had then been around for more than a thousand years."}
{"translation": "The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated."}
{"translation": "The Vatican City State drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian."}
{"translation": "Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies."}
{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, peoples have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was more about the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that these last ones transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the appearance of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses."}

{"translation": "Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so that they tend to break down with little or no pressure."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon is made of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face."}
{"translation": "It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on what makes people feel good or attracted."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized over the course of their maturation into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what pushes certain people to want to do what they do and what in their environment pushes them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular theories of content are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is to try to remain \"the good friend\" (or \"the good friend\")."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has difficulty taking unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, making evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his/her way."}
{"translation": "In the end, the manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disputes between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the team of management to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives linked to the practice of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all the available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the client."}
{"translation": "Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow us to reduce the field of research and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "We know for a long time that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumours and traumatic brain injuries affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science which studies the intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring an intelligent approach by machines."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday life problems."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been used in several computer software and video games."}
{"translation": "Field trips are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can look at ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating in a practical excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet High School in North Carolina design each year a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students to improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blogging experience with a neglected grammar and orthography, the fact of having an audience generally improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"requires students to better know the world that surrounds them\". The need to attract the attention of the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs \"can help students strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by reacting actively to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on well-defined topics\" (Oravec, 2002).\""}
