{"translation": "City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate distribution."}
{"translation": "Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognised as proper civilisations."}
{"translation": "During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted only of the Congress."}

{"translation": "They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who hurled threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the mob turned the head of a slain royal guard in front of the horrified Queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenditures of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the costs, and the interest on loans flowed through the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the foundation of the order."}
{"translation": "The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000\u20131300 AD)."}
{"translation": "The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views. One, that the development of technology follows a path which is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and two, that technology has effects on societies which are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the automobile is unavoidably linked to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the medical field to repair damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of romanticism, it is the geography that shapes individuals. Over time, customs and cultures emerged that refer to this geography, and these, because they are in harmony with the place of society, are better than arbitrarily imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe in the past."}
{"translation": "His fame as the center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D."}
{"translation": "His status declined over the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At that time the title of the fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind the times."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began using buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological farming method that uses saved, locally adapted seed and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries, this is still the case."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differentiate themselves in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members from other subcultures."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by an unmistakable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their childhood."}
{"translation": "\"Such children are called \"feral\" or wild. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical disabilities.\""}
{"translation": "Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wilderness."}
{"translation": "If it was completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behavior patterns (within the limits of its physical abilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clamp in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest, and explain steps that the student may not be able to complete alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse and blackmail."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so."}
{"translation": "For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The nursing home is supposed to cover all the needs that they did not receive in the home from which they were removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}

{"translation": "The use of video recordings has led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting the slightest changes in facial expression."}
{"translation": "In his article \"The President's Speech\", Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to a brain injury can still judge the honesty of people correctly."}
{"translation": "He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals like dogs."}
{"translation": "Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation leads to new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to cover its need for amino acids from available plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you don't do it: Growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein, which contain all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "It shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in a similar way to how the chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Sleep deprivation is the process of waking up deliberately during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you are someone who wakes up the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Another method based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive is the available life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction."}
{"translation": "Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga."}

{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations."}
{"translation": "At the center of Tibetan meditation is the god-yoga. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and the culture led to the fact that the countries became enemies."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It should last for the next 40 years and in reality be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already completely broken and the only hope was a retreat and a reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after they had violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern regions of Poland."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The navy's job was traditionally to ensure that a country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time to hinder the enemy's ability to transport people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep them as pets to get easily at their milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "House goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures. They were tended by shepherds, just like the more familiar sheep shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, England had built inclined planes."}
{"translation": "Although the freight tracks consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time."}
{"translation": "Already quite early, rails were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, the realization was made that rails, which are made of iron bands, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This became the norm, but the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden axles of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known form of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means \"upright man\") two million years ago."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in an environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is often just like a symptomatic treatment. If you however want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is really obvious that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people have become more serious."}
{"translation": "After his farewell by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten, signed by the Congress President John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap a few blocks away."}

{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "Of the 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist, they are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the ages."}
{"translation": "Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds."}
{"translation": "Many don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly."}
{"translation": "But many things about birds still look like those of a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex."}
{"translation": "Most computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in binary form."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best sign of poisoning by swallowing is the presence of an open container with medicines or toxic household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison."}
{"translation": "The term \u201ecrane fly\u201c is used by entomologists in a formal sense for these insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Both ravenous and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or the dwelling of their hosts."}
{"translation": "In the United States of America there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most widespread neurological disease among adults of younger and middle age."}
{"translation": "MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A couple can decide that it is not in their own or their child's interest to raise a child."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to adopt a baby."}
{"translation": "In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over parenthood."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "It's not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by the posing of questions and the conducting of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often based to a large extent on the presence of internal cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Behaviors that are not only reactions to signals from external cycles are known for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals can execute free-swinging cycles for a certain time."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They took two experiments, in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or marked a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on what kind of mutation it is, what significance the affected piece of genetic material has and whether the cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals."}

{"translation": "Every morning people leave small provincial towns in their cars to go to work and are passed by others who have just left their workplace."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic pendulum traffic, all are in some way connected to a transport system based on the private car, and support it."}
{"translation": "Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone participates in the society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear as many complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers just incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, as drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, drivers tend to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically."}
{"translation": "In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of facilities at the roadside."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently."}
{"translation": "Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This way they have a wider choice of hiding places, where they can hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back."}
{"translation": "Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun is at the center of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars) moved around the Earth."}
{"translation": "This seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem as if the earth is moving, or?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon is the second-longest and second-largest river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river."}

{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "This was more in line with the four aggregation states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. It also posited that they could change into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table."}

{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon."}
{"translation": "The universe as a whole is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles, which are called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "As a result, the pencil, after its invention, became a good friend to many people."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the pencil has been pushed into the background by the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been relegated to its status and use."}
{"translation": "Nowadays people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come close to a typewriter."}
{"translation": "One can be excited about what will come out of the keyboard when something new comes along."}
{"translation": "The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons."}
{"translation": "About the same as when you roll a heavy vehicle up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy is released."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they will disintegrate at the slightest or even no provocation."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust."}

{"translation": "On the near side there could be more Maria, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature."}

{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general there are two behaviours when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to \"stay one of the guys\" (or one of the girls)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities and taking on employees."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who does everything differently than the team did and takes everything for themselves."}
{"translation": "In the end, the team manager is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are led to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The \"invisible team\" is the leadership team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge."}
{"translation": "As a result, the collective work of an organization can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs."}

{"translation": "It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, such as traumas, injuries and tumours, influence behaviour and cause changes in certain brain functions."}
{"translation": "New technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time."}
{"translation": "This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our head."}
{"translation": "KI (K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz) is often associated with science fiction, but is a key branch of computer science that deals with behaviour, learning and the adaptation of machines to intelligent behaviour."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of AI includes the construction of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour."}
{"translation": "Examples of this are controlling, setting up strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems."}
{"translation": "The KI system is now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and the military and has been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently a teacher would like to take her pupils to places which cannot be reached by bus."}
{"translation": "Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum exhibits from their classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art."}
{"translation": "Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience."}
{"translation": "Students are often a very critical audience, so the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "Blogging \"forces the students to learn more about the world around them.\" The need to attract the interest of the audience inspires the students to write cleverly and interestingly (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning outside the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "The appropriate use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and express their own perspectives on certain topics. (Oravec, 2002)"}
