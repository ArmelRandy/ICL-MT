{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences, if you do not take it up: depression, hunger and finally death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
