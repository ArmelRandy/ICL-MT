{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His luxury as the center of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders were rewarded with goods such as wine and cheese, which were valued more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "In an adoption, the biological parents give their parental rights to the adoptive parents, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
