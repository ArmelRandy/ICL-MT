{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you let it happen: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had started to build railways."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the wheels were made from parallel strips of wood, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Spikes were first used to secure the position of the wheels. However, it soon became clear that wheels, which were made of a band of iron, were more efficient."}
