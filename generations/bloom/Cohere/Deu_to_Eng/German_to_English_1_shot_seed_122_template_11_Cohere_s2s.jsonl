On the one hand, that technological development itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than social determined."}
{"translation": "It may be possible to say that the person-power car is unusually conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "The center of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as bread and wine, were returned to the church, which valued them more than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "Wolves may have had the opportunity to experience or have been exposed to traumatic experiences before they were used or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be taken care of; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If the animals are completely removed from the wild, the wild animal shows its behaviour (within its physical possibilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, for example, its fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals in a new learning situation are supported, for example, by the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real objects can both exist. In other words, a teacher is a form of virtual object, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual simulations are built into the software and should be questions, which the student alone may not be able to answer, ask, and explain."}
{"translation": "Children are often placed in care families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even from bullying to bullying."}

{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, so we have to eat them raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict the behavior of drivers with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some car drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
