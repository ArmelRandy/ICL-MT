{"translation": "The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that technological development itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technological development has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "It may be possible to say that the person-power car is unusually conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was developed by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}

{"translation": "So as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "The center of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the pilgrims were returning with gifts such as silk and gold, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine art."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of the fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The gotic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"verwildert\". Some of them were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to care for the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences, before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be taken care of; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If the animals are completely removed from the wild, the wild animal shows its behaviour (within its physical possibilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, for example, its fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals in a new learning situation are supported, for example, by the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Teachers can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of a student, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual simulations are built into the software and should be questions, which the student alone may not be able to answer, ask, and explain."}
{"translation": "Children are taken into care from a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to physical abuse to psychological abuse."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a foraging system like that of man, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants, which are the main source of these nutrients."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you don't do it: depression, hunger and eventually death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to eat, because they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to control the traffic mainly with U-Boats."}
{"translation": "The Allies were defeated, so Germany could have ruled Britain just as easily as the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It is believed that probably around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran, domestic animals were domesticated."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and peoples began to keep livestock to make it easier to get milk, meat, fodder and clothing."}

{"translation": "Two-handed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to make a little bit of progress."}
{"translation": "This is often a symptom of a more serious problem. If you still want to solve the problem, we should find the root cause and treat it."}

{"translation": "A few people may say that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their children to make a baby big."}
{"translation": "This couple can decide for an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "With adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}

{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were well known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge the West lost its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}

{"translation": "In developing countries, you rarely hear many complaints about water quality or bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes every day? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
