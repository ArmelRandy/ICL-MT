{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a digestive system like that of man, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you do not take it up: depression, lack of energy and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}
