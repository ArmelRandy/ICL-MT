{"translation": "Its centre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that crusaders were rewarded with goods such as silk and gold, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

Some verwildert children were taken away by their own parents (for example, by their own parents); in some cases the kidnapping of the child was due to the inability of the parents to return, the extreme intellectual or physical limitations of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other people should be allowed to be around animals; some should only be allowed to live in the wild."}

{"translation": "In addition, it has serious consequences if you let it happen: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
