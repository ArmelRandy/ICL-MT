{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more internal than social."}
{"translation": "It can be argued that the personal car is unlikely to contribute to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically not viable. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership."}
{"translation": "The widespread ownership of cars leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which again leads to the development of new techniques in the health field for the repair of damaged bodies."}
{"translation": "The Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which sprang from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that matters. Individuals formed the landscape. With the passage of time, the needs and cultures of these people were better than those imposed by arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His role as the centre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that crusaders were returning with goods such as silk and wine, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West depend on the length of the communication channels 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use knots to fix clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his or her family."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation by using a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most important ways to highlight the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate children who are victims of neglect, misfortune, or maltreatment during their childhood and are not socially integrated by their parents."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"verwildert\" or wild. Some verwildert children were taken away by their own parents; in some cases the parents' refusal to return the child was due to the child's inability to accept the parents' limitations, such as intellectual or physical disabilities."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should be left alone in the wild."}

{"translation": "Children are often placed in care families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to physical abuse to emotional abuse."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to live in an environment that is not safe, loving and educational, but many are."}

{"translation": "He also understands that the abilities to interpret human behavior, such as dog training, may be shared with animals."}
{"translation": "Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection eliminates these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Outdoors in the savanna it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of man to obtain amino acids from plants that are available to him."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you do not take it up: depression, lack of energy and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "As a whole, it should not upset us if our own ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savanna today."}
{"translation": "Sleep interruption is the process of awakening during the normal sleep period and short awakening (10-60 minutes) later."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built support poles."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the roadbeds were only made up of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Already in ancient times, wooden steps were used to protect the position of the riders. However, it was discovered that riders who carried a band of iron were more efficient."}

{"translation": "Finally, the wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767 the first iron rafts were introduced."}

{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help reduce future suffering."}
{"translation": "This is usually a symptomatically treated condition. If you still want to find a solution, we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is very likely that the world has changed due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans are becoming more and more difficult."}

{"translation": "When adopting a child, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to find out how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some car drivers are not consistent in their behavior; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modeled."}
{"translation": "To improve the traffic flow, the connections between the three most important factors were defined: (1) River, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of railway stations."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to reach the heavens. Their ability to fly made them easier to hunt and more efficient in finding food and mates."}

{"translation": "Today, only insects that do not have wings can fly backwards."}
{"translation": "About a thousand years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the Sun is in the middle of the movements of the solar system."}
