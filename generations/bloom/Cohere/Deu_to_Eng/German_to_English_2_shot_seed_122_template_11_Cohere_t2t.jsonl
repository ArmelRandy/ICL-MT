{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography, the individuals. With the time, the problems and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and this, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than willingly imposed laws."}
{"translation": "So as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His luxury as the center of luxury began about 400 n. Chr. and lasted until about 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross-religionists were rewarded with goods such as silk and gold, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine art."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"verwildert\". Some of them were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to take care of the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be kept in captivity; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you do not do it: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Domesticated animals were probably already present in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep livestock to make it easier to get milk, meat, wool and hides."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, English people had established guilds."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the wheels were made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the wagons to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on roads of the same time."}
{"translation": "Already in the early days, wheels were used to keep track of the position of the wagons. However, it was soon discovered that wagons, which were made of iron, were more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron made the wheels more vulnerable to damage."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden arrows were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first iron arrows were introduced."}
