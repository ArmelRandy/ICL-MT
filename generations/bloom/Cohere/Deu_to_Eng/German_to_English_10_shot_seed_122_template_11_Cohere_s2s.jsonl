{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or killed."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be kept in captivity; some should be kept only in the wild."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a digestive system like that of man, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you do not take it up: depression, lack of energy and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, not all drivers are consistent in their behavior; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modeled."}
