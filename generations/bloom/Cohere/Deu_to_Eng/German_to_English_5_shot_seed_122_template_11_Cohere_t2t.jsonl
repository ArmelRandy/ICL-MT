{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its center of luxury began about 400 n. Chr. and lasted until about 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that crusaders were rewarded with goods such as silk and gold, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}

{"translation": "One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring supplies and troops over the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to block the trade mainly with U-Boats."}
{"translation": "Because the Allies had broken up, Germany could probably have ruled Britain just as well as the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Cattle were probably domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in the Middle East around 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep livestock to make it easier to get milk, meat, fodder and clothing."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had started to build lighthouses."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the forks were mainly made of parallel wood bristles, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Already in ancient times, wheels were used to keep track of the position of the wagons. However, it was soon discovered that wagons, which were made of iron, were more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron made the wheels more prone to break."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767, the first fully iron rafts were introduced."}

{"translation": "With an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge, the West lost its philosophical and scientific interests in Greece."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some car drivers try to be consistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
{"translation": "To improve traffic flow, the connections between the three most important features were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the railway."}
