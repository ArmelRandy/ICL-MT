{"translation": "Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the confines of this worldly life. He had the habit of going to a cave that became famous under the name of \"Hira\" on the mountain of \"Noor\" (light) for contemplation."}
{"translation": "The cave itself, which survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations."}
{"translation": "Located atop one of the mountains in the northern part of Mecca, this cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world."}
{"translation": "In fact, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated."}
{"translation": "Above, you can only see the clear sky and beautiful mountains around. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today."}
{"translation": "Constructed by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many gigantic structures erected in honour of the deceased pharaohs."}
{"translation": "The plateau of Giza, or \"Giza Necropolis\", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, comprises several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, numerous temples and the great Sphinx."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Kh\u00e9ops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" looks like a V and the symbol \"pull\" looks like a hook or a square with the lower side missing."}
{"translation": "The top means you must start at the tip and pull the bow, and the bottom means you must start at the top (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "A bowed string produces generally a softer sound, while a bowed string is more assertive and loud."}
{"translation": "Do not hesitate to write your own marks on the paper, but remember that the marks on the bow are for musical purposes only, and that it is generally best to follow them."}
{"translation": "On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11\u00a0years old, and Louis-Charles, 4\u00a0years old) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the crowd raised the head of a Royal Guardsman killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen."}
{"translation": "The war expenses of the American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the obligations issued by the Philippine government on behalf of the banks of Wall Street."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism."}

{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "The technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself occurs beyond the cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "Massive possession of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, with time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD."}
{"translation": "During the 12th century, the status of Cambodia declined mainly because the Crusaders came back loaded with silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th\u201311th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slow pace of communication, Western modes could accuse a delay of 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological, system using locally conserved seed, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures are groups of individuals who feel neglected by the social norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses modes, manners and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wilderness."}
{"translation": "When fully raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a learning method but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is one too."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are meant to question, guide and explain procedures that would have been too difficult to manage for the student alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons that range from neglect to abuse, to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but that's the case."}
{"translation": "We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications."}
{"translation": "For example, \"apprenticeship\" and \"socialization\" are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}

{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions lasting for a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article \"The President's Speech\", indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain injuries are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in domestic dogs."}
{"translation": "The 20th century research has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs of variation\u00a0: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (bees, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally awakening during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm, so that you wake up without being completely woken up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other rhythmic possibilities include drinking a lot of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, which are diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension is, the more vital force is present. Each person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is composed of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the universal love path."}
{"translation": "With the Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The Tibetan meditation center is the yoga of the deity. It is through visualizing different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and consciousness awakened."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the cooperation between these two countries."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began."}
{"translation": "It would last for 40 years and see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields both in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian front."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost immediately, when more than 800,000 Soviet Union soldiers arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, whether they were bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Traditionally, the work of navies has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the recent most remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to ferry soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic to help the British."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just as she did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them to have easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "The \"wagonways\" were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks were simply wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than the slightly more uneven roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbars were introduced fairly early to keep the runways in place. However, it soon became apparent that the runways would be more effective if they were fitted with a strip of iron on top."}
{"translation": "It has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can begin to live in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress made by humans, and that the problems are becoming more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the president of Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as \"Dunlap Broads\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document took place in the hall of the Independence Hall on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap leaves still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many palaeontologists think today that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Very few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They are covered with scales and have claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is coded in binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can have only two values : 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible."}

{"translation": "Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduces (also known as bed bugs) are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men."}
{"translation": "A couple can very well decide that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that eliminates one or several of the possible hypotheses, poses questions and makes observations, but also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend often on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with a radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism is an activity that attracts people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, especially the fauna and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on site."}
{"translation": "One can, for example, go and see, photograph and discover orang-utans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow \u2013 the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act in a fairly consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a fairly consistent range and can be approximated mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design, and operate road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more efficiently food and companions."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera."}
{"translation": "About a thousand years ago, a man called Aristarque claimed that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river."}

{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since Antiquity, peoples have been familiar with the basic elements of chemistry such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was the earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also proposed the theory that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}

{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so tiny that billions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out."}

{"translation": "It is thinner at the sea level and thicker at the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Theories of content focus on the search for what makes people feel good or attractive."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized over the course of their maturation into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is to try to remain \"the good friend\" (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time taking unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his or her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the team leader is ultimately responsible for success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose the cumbersome process of creating an organizational learning structure\u2009? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's need."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create an innovation culture, shared knowledge and its own learning culture."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents Continuum as a method used to help organisations to achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neuro-biological data provide empirical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore reduce the scope of research and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain injuries affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build models of simulation that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although artificial intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science which studies the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims at automating by machines tasks requiring intelligent approaches."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and questions of clients, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on the contribution of solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been used in several home computer and video game software."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his/her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch ancient objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a stunning artwork while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try out blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having a public audience usually improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"obliges students to better understand the world around them\". The need to spark interest in the public encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"Lorsqu'on en fait bon usage, blogs \"can allow students to strengthen their analytical and critical capacities: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own points of view on specific topics\" (Oravec, 2002)."}
