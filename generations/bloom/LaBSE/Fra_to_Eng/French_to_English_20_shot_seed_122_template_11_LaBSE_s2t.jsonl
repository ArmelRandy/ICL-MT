{"translation": "During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government \u2014 the Congress being its only component \u2014 under the Articles of Confederation."}

{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who screamed threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages."}
{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd raised the head of a Royal Guardsman killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen."}
{"translation": "The American war spending in the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the obligations issued by the Philippine government on behalf of Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages \u2013 period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The possession of many cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, with time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began in the 4th century and lasted until the 11th century."}
{"translation": "By the 12th century, its status declined mainly because the Crusaders came back loaded with silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th\u2013 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At first, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slow speed of communication, Western modes could accuse a 25 to 30 year lag."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, using preserved seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures gather individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic style, which encompasses modes, manners and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune, or voluntary abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children might have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some would have been raised by animals\u2009; some would have lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When fully raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners who are discovering a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone of Microsoft Office is one too."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that would have been too difficult for the student to manage on their own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons that range from neglect to abuse, to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but that's the case."}
{"translation": "We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home where they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and gratifications."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are considered to be major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal involvement\" and \"continuous relationships\" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to internet sites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions lasting for a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article \"The President's Speech\", indicated how people with brain injuries who cannot understand the speech are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in domestic animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "The 20th century research showed that there are two genetic reservoirs of variation\u00a0: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the plant resources available."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (termites, ants, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" a little bit like the chimps of the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally awakening during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm to wake you up without completely waking you up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other biologically based options include drinking a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his or her body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the universal love path."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan Buddhism is the deity yoga. It is through visualisation of different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and awakening consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended their cooperation."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields both in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian head of the bridge."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet troops arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they invaded the east of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans."}
{"translation": "Marine work traditionally has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to ferry troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop the traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just as it did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them so they could easily access milk, fur, meat and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "The \u201cwaggonways\u201d were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks were simply wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbeams were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, it soon became apparent that tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a steel strip on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, though Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and deactivate it."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that problems have become more important due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as \"Dunlap Broadside\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap leaves known to still exist are the oldest known copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many palaeontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Very few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are lots of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They have scales on their legs and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their rear legs like T-Rexes."}
{"translation": "All computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded as binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for the jargon of computer science."}
{"translation": "Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to preclude an immediate diagnosis."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of drugs or household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduces, just like bed bugs, are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to make a project adoption for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experience is a test that eliminates one or more of the possible hypotheses, poses questions and makes observations, but also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend often on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with a radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can kill cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism interests people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, especially the fauna and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities."}
{"translation": "One can, for example, go and see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transport shuttle each is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and the support."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act in a fairly consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a fairly consistent range and can be approximated mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design and operate road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and find more efficiently food and companions."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body."}
{"translation": "This gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera."}
{"translation": "A few thousand years ago, an Aristarque man claimed that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, reaching sometimes 10 km wide."}
{"translation": "Not less than 20% of the water that pours into the oceans from rivers comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers."}
{"translation": "Though the construction of stone pyramids continued into the end of the Old Empire, the Giza Pyramids never surpassed their size or the technical excellence of their construction."}

{"translation": "All citizens of the Vatican City are Catholic."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, peoples have been familiar with the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also emitted the theory that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into this sentence."}
{"translation": "Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more discreet and rare role."}
{"translation": "People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to get near a typewriter."}
{"translation": "We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new feature arrives."}
{"translation": "The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a myriad of protons and neutrons into a nucleus."}
{"translation": "Like if you were to lift a heavy cart up a hill. By splitting the nucleus again and releasing a little of this energy."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure."}
{"translation": "The moon's surface is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the hidden side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner in the seas and thicker on the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Theories of content focus on what makes people feel good or attractive."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized over the course of their maturation into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain \"the good friend\" (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time taking unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his or her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the chef is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \u201cinvisible team\u201d is the management team to which each member reports. It establishes standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose on itself the cumbersome process of creating an organizational learning structure\u2009? One of the goals associated with the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client\u2019s need."}
{"translation": "Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create an innovation culture, shared knowledge and its own learning culture."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents Continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neuro-biological data provide evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore allow for a reduction in the scope of research and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of brain damage, lesions, tumors and traumatic brain injuries affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions."}
{"translation": "The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science which studies the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring intelligent approaches."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on solving everyday problems."}
{"translation": "The artificial intelligence system is now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering and the military, just as it has been used in several home computer and video game software."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is brought about by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at old objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating practically to an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students at Bennet College in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blogging experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having a public audience usually improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"obliges students to better understand the world around them\". The need to attract the public's interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs can allow students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking abilities: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own views on specific topics\" (Oravec, 2002)."}
{"translation": "Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight the past and present of Canada."}
