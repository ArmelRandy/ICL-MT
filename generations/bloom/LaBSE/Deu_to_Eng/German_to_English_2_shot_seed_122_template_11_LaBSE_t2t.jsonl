{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West depend on the length of communication channels 25 to 30 years later."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to wear hats as a result of the need to tie their hair."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture that aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his/her family."}

{"translation": "Wolves might have had massive litters or traumatic experiences, before they were used or released."}
{"translation": "Some people should be killed by animals; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been exterminated, it shows the wild kind behaviour (in the context of its body's possibilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, for example, its fear or its ability to resist humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a feeding system like ours to get its needs for amino acids from plants."}
{"translation": "There are also serious consequences if you do not stop: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, because they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "The use of ships for passenger transport is the most efficient method for transporting large people and goods over the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the Marine was traditionally to ensure that a country was in a position to provide people and goods, and to prevent the enemy from providing people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring troops and material over the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain."}

{"translation": "Finally, the wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767 the first complete iron rafts were introduced."}

{"translation": "The second type is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs by seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to make a little difference in the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptomatic treatment. If you nevertheless do not want only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "With an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights to another couple, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody talks about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they happen regularly? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is there something deeper going on here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individuals and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some drivers try to behave consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
