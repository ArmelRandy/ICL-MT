{"translation": "The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that technological development itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than social determined."}
{"translation": "One can probably assume that the person-powered vehicle is bringing about unforeseen development in the streets."}

{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the center of luxury began roughly around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until roughly 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross-religionists were rewarded with goods such as wine and cheese, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West have been influenced by the long-distance communication channels 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use knots to fix clothing."}

{"translation": "One of the most important ways to increase the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who are not socially integrated because of neglect, misfortune or unintentional abuse during childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"out of control\". Some of them were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the parents' refusal to take care of the child was the main reason for the child's removal."}
{"translation": "Wolves may have had massive litters or traumatic experiences, before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Some animals should be kept in captivity; some should be allowed to live in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been exterminated, it shows the wild kind behaviour (in the context of its body's possibilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, for example, its fear or its ability to resist humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a foraging system like that of humans to get its needs for amino acids from plants that are not yet ready to be harvested."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you do not stop: depression, malnutrition and finally death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built railways."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the rails were only supported by parallel timber poles, they allowed the wagons to reach higher speeds and to travel longer distances than on the roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Spikes were already being used to secure the position of the chariots. But after a while it became clear that chariots that carried a band of iron were more efficient."}

{"translation": "Finally, the wood rails were replaced by steel rails. In 1767, the first complete steel rails were introduced."}

{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to a certain extent, to lessen the burden of the future."}

{"translation": "A few may say that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their children to grow a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights to the adoptive parents, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge, the West lost its philosophical and scientific interests in Greece."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody knows about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear many complaints about the water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems get into such misunderstandings, why do they get into trouble every now and then? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
{"translation": "To improve the traffic flow, the connections between the three most important features were defined: (1) River, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of buildings on the railway."}

{"translation": "This allows them to choose from a wider range of smaller boats, in which they can hide from raiding."}
{"translation": "Today insects are the only animals that their wings cannot fold back."}
{"translation": "About a hundred years ago, a man named Aristarch believed that the sun is in the middle of the movements of the solar system."}
