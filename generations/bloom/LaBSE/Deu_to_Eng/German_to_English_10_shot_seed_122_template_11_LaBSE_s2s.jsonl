With the time came the needs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than would have been the case if the laws had been imposed by force."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the centre of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the 12th century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as seeds and herbs, were returned to their original owners, who valued them more than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West depend on the length of the communication channels 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashions as a result of the fashions."}

Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to cope with the child's unusual intellectual or physical disabilities."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Some should be kept in captivity; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is for a primate with a locomotion system like human beings to be very difficult, to provide its needs for amino acids from plants that are not available."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, it has serious consequences if you do not: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest sources of food were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "With an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some car drivers try to be consistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
