{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was created by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that shapes the individuals. With the time came the needs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than willfully imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the centre of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the pilgrims were returning with gifts such as spices and fruits, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West have been influenced by the long-distance communication channels for 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use knots to fix clothing."}

{"translation": "One of the most common methods to highlight the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unlucky or accidentally abused during their childhood and not socialized by their parents."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"wild\". Some wild children were taken away from their parents (commonly by their own parents); in some cases the kidnapping of the child was due to the inability of the parents to cope with the exceptional intellectual or physical limitations of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive human disturbances or traumatic events, before they were released or killed."}

{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real objects can both be created. With other words, a teacher is a form of virtual object, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}

{"translation": "Outdoors in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a digestion system like that of humans to get its needs for amino acids from plants."}
{"translation": "Furthermore, it has serious consequences if you do not: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to reach food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

This method of storing household goods is still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had started to build railways."}

{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to a small extent, to ease the burden of the future."}
{"translation": "This is often treated symptomatically. If, however, you do not just want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "With an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because it is impossible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some drivers try to behave in a more consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
