{"translation": "The cave is located on the top of one of the cliffs north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world."}

{"translation": "The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that technological development itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are rather inherent than social in nature."}
{"translation": "One can probably assume that the personal car is unusually involved in the development of streets."}

{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the centre of luxury began roughly around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until roughly 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was especially due to the fact that the pilgrims were returning with gifts such as wine and cheese, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The gotic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use knots to fix clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his/her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, sometimes biological building technique, which uses locally available, in the humid climate of the Eastern Mediterranean region, natural resources and relatively simple building techniques to maximise the harvest."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}

{"translation": "Wolves may have had massive litters or traumatic experiences, before they were used or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Some people should be killed; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been exterminated, the wild child shows the behavioural patterns (in the context of his body's possibilities) that are almost completely in agreement with those of his specific prey, for example, his fear or his ability to resist humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Students can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of student, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistants are built into the software and should be able to ask questions that the student alone may not be able to answer, and explain them."}
{"translation": "Children are taken into care from a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to physical abuse to psychological abuse."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to live in an environment that is not safe, loving and educational, but many are."}

{"translation": "Mutation is the source of new genetic variation and selection eliminates these from the pool of expressed variation."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a feeding system like that of humans to get its needs for amino acids from plants that are not readily available."}
{"translation": "Moreover, it has serious consequences if you do not drink it: depression, malnutrition and finally death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to eat, because they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "In sum, it should not upset us if our own ancestors had solved the protein problem in the same way as the elephants in the savanna today."}

{"translation": "Two types of fossils have been found in Australopithecus specimens dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a friendly environment, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to make a little bit of progress."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a more serious problem. However, if you are not only looking for temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}
{"translation": "It is certainly true that the world has been affected by the scientific and technological progress of mankind and that the problems caused by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people are becoming more and more difficult to solve."}

{"translation": "Look at the label on the box for specific first aid instructions for this special gift."}
{"translation": "The word \"weevil\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group."}

{"translation": "In an adoption, the natural parents give their parental rights to the adoptive parents, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by the setting of questions and the conducting of observations."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody is aware of the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems get into such misunderstandings, why do they get into such misunderstandings on a regular basis? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
{"translation": "To improve the traffic flow, the connections between the three most important features were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
