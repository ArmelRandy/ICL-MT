{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to eat, because they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "In sum, it should not upset us if our own ancestors have solved the protein problem in a similar way as the elephants in the savanna today."}
