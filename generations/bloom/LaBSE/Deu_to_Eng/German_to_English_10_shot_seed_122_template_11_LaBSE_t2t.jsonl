{"translation": "The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are rather inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One can probably assume that the person-powered vehicle is not conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "The Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was fostered by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography, the individuals. With the time came the needs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than willingly imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that pilgrims were returning with gifts such as spices and fruits, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "However, styles in the West depend on the length of communication channels 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashion of the times by wearing buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his/her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, sometimes biological building technique which uses off-farm, in the arid region of the Namib desert, natural resources and with other relatively simple techniques, to maximise the harvest."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture and in many developing countries this is still the case."}

{"translation": "One of the most important ways to highlight the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who are not socially integrated because of neglect, misfortune or misuse during childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"out of control\". Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the parents' refusal to accept the child's disability was the main reason for the child's removal."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Some people should be kept in captivity; some should be left in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been exterminated, the wild child shows behaviors (within the limits of his body's capabilities) that are almost completely in agreement with those of his specific species, for example, his fear or his ability to coexist with humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real objects can both exist. With other words, a teacher is a form of virtual object, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistants are built into software and are intended to be used by people who are not able to visit the castle in person, rather than waiting for them to come to the castle.\nEin bekanntes Beispiel ist das Castle in N\u00fcrnberg, der sich als ein bekanntes Beispiel f\u00fcr das Bildungsstaat besitzt.\nEin bekanntes Beispiel ist das Castle in N\u00fcrnberg, der sich als ein bekan"}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation up and down."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a feeding system like ours to get its needs for amino acids from plants that have them on hand."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you do not stop: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also contain large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "In summary, it should not upset us that our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way as the savanna elephants today."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had started to build railways."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the tracks were mostly made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the rougher roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Already in the early stages of the war, wells were dug to keep track of the position of the ships. But as the knowledge grew, it was discovered that ships that carried a band of iron were more efficient."}

{"translation": "Finally, the wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767, the first complete iron rafts were introduced."}

{"translation": "Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this special gift."}
{"translation": "The word \"wanze\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group."}

{"translation": "A few people may feel that it is not in their own interests or in the interests of their children to grow a baby."}
{"translation": "This couple can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were well known."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone talks about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear many complaints about water quality or bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes on a regular basis? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is impossible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some drivers try to behave in a more consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
{"translation": "To improve traffic flow, the connections between the three most important features were defined: (1) River, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the railway."}
