{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more internal than social."}
{"translation": "One can probably assume that the person-powered vehicle is bringing about unforeseen development in the streets."}

{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the centre of luxury began roughly around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until roughly 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross-realm merchants were returning with goods such as spices and textiles, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West depend on the length of communication channels 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashion of the times by using buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture, which aims to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the landowner and his/her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, sometimes biological building method, which uses organic waste, in the humid subtropical region, and which is linked to agriculture or other relatively simple techniques to maximise the harvest."}

{"translation": "Wolves may have experienced traumatic experiences or have had massive litters, before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Some animals should be kept in captivity; some should be left in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been exterminated, the wild kind shows behavioural traits (within its body's possibilities) that are almost completely identical to those of its specific prey, for example, its fear or its ability to resist humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real events can both happen. In other words, a teacher is a form of event, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a foraging system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that are available to humans."}
{"translation": "Moreover, it has serious consequences if you do not stop: depression, malnutrition and finally death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "In sum, it should not upset us if our own ancestors have solved the protein problem in a similar way as the elephants in the savanna today."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built fortifications."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the wheels were made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and to carry greater loads than on the rougher roads of earlier times."}
{"translation": "Already in the early stages of the war, wheels were used to keep track of the position of the chariots. But as the knowledge grew, it was found that chariots that carried a band of iron were more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron was better at preventing rust on the rusty wheels of the cars."}
{"translation": "Finally, the wood rails were replaced by steel rails. In 1767, the first complete steel rails were introduced."}

{"translation": "Your ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not do so regularly."}
{"translation": "Two types of fossils have been found in Australopithecus specimens dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, though Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to make a little difference in the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a treatment. However, if you do not only want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "With an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights to another couple, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge, the West lost its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody is aware of transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developing countries, you rarely hear many complaints about water quality or bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems cause such mistakes, why do they happen regularly? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some car drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
{"translation": "To improve the traffic flow, the connections between the three most important features were defined: (1) River, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in planning, designing and operating railway stations."}

{"translation": "By virtue of this, they have a wider choice of small compartments, in which they can hide from robbery."}
{"translation": "Today insects are the only animals that cannot fly back their wings."}
{"translation": "About a hundred years ago, a man named Aristarch said that the sun is in the middle of the movements of the solar system."}
{"translation": "Many people thought that it was right, but many believed that it was wrong: that the Sun (and even the other stars) move around the Earth."}
