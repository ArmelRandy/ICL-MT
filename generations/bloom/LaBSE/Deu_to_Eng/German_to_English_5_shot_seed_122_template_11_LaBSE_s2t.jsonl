{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more internal than social."}
{"translation": "It is possible to assume that the person-powered car is unusually involved in the development of roads."}

{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was developed by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that forms the individuals. With the time came the needs and cultures that depended on this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His luxury as the centre of luxury began roughly 400 years ago and lasted until roughly 1100 years ago."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the pilgrims were returning with gifts such as spices and fruits, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West have been influenced by long-distance communication channels for 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use knots to fix clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his/her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological building technique, which is based on the use of organic matter, in the boreal forest region, and which is linked to agriculture or other relatively simple techniques to maximise the harvest."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers and in many developing countries the situation has remained the same."}
{"translation": "Subcultures bring together people who feel different from society\u2019s norms and allow them to develop an identity."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture signal their affiliation often by an unchanging and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most important methods to increase the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unlucky or abused during their childhood and are not socially integrated by their parents."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"wild\". Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to take care of the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Some people should be allowed to be petted by animals; some should only be allowed to live in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been exterminated, the wild kind displays behavioural patterns (within its physical capabilities), which are almost completely in agreement with those of its specialized predators, for example, its fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real objects can both exist. With other words, a teacher is a form of virtual object, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistants are built into the software and should be able to ask questions that the student alone may not be able to answer, and explain them."}

{"translation": "There are also serious consequences if you do not stop: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "As a whole, it should not upset us if our own ancestors had solved the protein problem in the same way as the chimpanzees in the savanna today."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had started to build railways."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the rails were only made of parallel timber, they allowed the wagons to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Already in the early days, steps were laid to protect the position of the chariots. But as knowledge increased, it became clear that chariots that carried a band of iron were more efficient."}

{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to a small extent, to ease the pain of the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a more serious problem. If, however, you do not just want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "A few may say that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their children to grow up big."}
{"translation": "This couple can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were well known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge, the West lost its philosophical and scientific knowledge in Greece."}

{"translation": "In developing countries you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge construction."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems get into such misunderstandings, why do they make mistakes on a regular basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
