{"translation": "Most of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are rather inherent than social in nature."}
{"translation": "One can probably assume that the personal car is not conducive to the development of roads with itself."}

{"translation": "His role as the centre of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that pilgrims were returning with gifts such as seeds and fruits, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"out of control\". Some were taken away by their own parents (usually the parents themselves); in some cases the parents were forced to accept the child's inability to control his or her behavior, the extreme intellectual or physical limitations of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have had massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Some should be fed by animals; some should only live in the wild."}

{"translation": "Outdoors in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a foraging system like ours to get its needs for amino acids from plants, which are scarce."}
{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you do not stop: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because it is impossible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some car drivers try to behave in a more consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
