{"translation": "The cave itself, which survived the time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations."}
{"translation": "Situated at the top of one of the mountains in the northern part of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world."}
{"translation": "In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know that it exists. When we entered the cave, we were completely isolated."}
{"translation": "Above, one can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe."}

{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense according to which the fate of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car."}
{"translation": "The possession of a large number of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, with time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "In the same way as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a centre of luxury began about 400 years ago, and lasted until 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, primarily because the Crusaders returned home loaded with silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th\u201311th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "\"However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could accuse a delay of 25 to 30 years.\""}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothing."}
{"translation": "The subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence farming system is a simple, often biological, system that uses seeds from the ecoregion, combined with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures are groups of individuals who feel neglected by the social norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}

{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered ferocious or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further."}
{"translation": "The support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "The supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is also one."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to query, guide and explain procedures that would have been too difficult for the student to manage on their own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons that range from neglect to abuse, to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but this is the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the family placement system as a safe zone for these children."}

{"translation": "\"Separation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation.\""}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the plant resources available."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (termites, ants, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" a little bit like the chimpanzees of the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "Interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately awakening during your sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes)."}

{"translation": "Other possibilities based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before bedtime (especially water or tea, which are supposed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension is, the more positive the vital force is. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Buddhism in Tibet is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many techniques of yoga from India."}

{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the recent most remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to make it across the Atlantic Ocean to soldiers and equipment to help the British."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this trade."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them to have easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "The \u00ab\u00a0waggonways\u00a0\u00bb were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks were simply wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbars were introduced fairly early to keep the tracks in place. However, it soon became apparent that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a strip of iron on top."}
{"translation": "It has become a common practice, but iron rusts the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "There are bipedal specializations in the fossil record of Australopithecus, dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago."}
{"translation": "\"We can begin to live in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come.\""}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}

{"translation": "Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Redworms, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or the habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men."}
{"translation": "A couple can very well decide that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to take care of a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to do an adoption project for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents relinquish parental rights in order that another couple may raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific method. This method guides most scientific researches."}
{"translation": "However, this is not the only one, the experiment, and an experiment is a test that eliminates one or more of the possible hypotheses, poses questions and makes observations, but also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has been cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend often in large part on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They carried out two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the affected part of the genetic material and if the affected cells are germ cells."}

{"translation": "Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design, and operate road facilities."}

{"translation": "Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"hidden\" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each member reports. It establishes standards for each of them."}

{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although artificial intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims at automating tasks requiring intelligent approaches by machines."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and questions of clients, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on the provision of solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been implemented in several domestic computer software and video games."}

{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"obliges students to better understand the world around them\". The need to attract public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
