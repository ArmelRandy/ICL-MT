{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" looks like a V and the symbol \"pull\" looks like a clasp or a square with the lower side missing."}
{"translation": "The top means that you must start at the tip and pull the bow, and the bottom means that you must start at the top (where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow."}
{"translation": "A bow up produces a softer sound, while a bow down is stronger and more assertive."}
{"translation": "Do not hesitate to write your own marks on the board, but do not forget that the marks on the bow are for musical purposes and must therefore be respected."}
{"translation": "On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11\u00a0years old, and Louis-Charles, 4\u00a0years old) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages."}
{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd held up the head of a Royal Guardsman killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen."}
{"translation": "The U.S. war spending in the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the obligations issued by the Philippine government on behalf of Wall Street banks."}
{"translation": "Naturally, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism."}

{"translation": "The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "The technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself occurs beyond the cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive possession of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, with time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a luxury hub began around 400 and lasted until 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the 12th century, primarily because Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 13th centuries."}
{"translation": "At first, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could accuse a delay of 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is farming that is practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological, system that uses locally preserved seeds combined with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures gather individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or sex of members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic style, which includes modes, manners and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialised by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered ferocious or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some would have been raised by animals\u2009; some would have lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a learning method but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is also a form of support."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, guide and explain procedures that would have been too difficult for the student to manage on their own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons that range from neglect to abuse, to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but that is the case."}
{"translation": "We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving carers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications."}
{"translation": "For example, \"apprenticeship\" and \"socialization\" are considered to be major factors promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"Personal involvement\" and \"continuous relationships\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the reactions of the public to internet sites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions lasting for a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by interpreting correctly micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain injuries are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity."}
{"translation": "He suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in domestic animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "The twentieth century research showed that there are two genetic reservoirs of variation\u2009: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disturbances, malnutrition, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (termites, ants, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" a little bit the same way chimpanzees in the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally awakening during your sleep and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "It can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you wake up without being completely woken up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other options based on the biological rhythms include drinking a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which are supposed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension is, the more positive the vital force is. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and universal love."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. It is through visualizing different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awakening consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended their cooperation."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields both in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian head of bridge."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost immediately, when more than 800,000 Soviet troops arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the east of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the marines traditionally has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to ferry troops and equipment across the Atlantic to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this trade."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them to have easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks were simply wooden planks parallel to each other, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more bumpy roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbars were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place. However, it soon became apparent that the runways would be more effective if they were fitted with a strip of iron on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "There are bipedal specializations in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and deactivate it."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing house of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as \"Dunlap Broadsides\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document took place in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap leaves still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many palaeontologists now think that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Very few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They are covered with scales and have claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for the jargon of computer science."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of drugs or household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Red worms, just like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, comprising the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men."}
{"translation": "A couple can very well estimate that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to do an adoption project for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of an adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to pose questions and to make observations, but also to direct scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend often in large part on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experience was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism interests people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information are examples of activities on site."}
{"translation": "One can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transport shuttle, each is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and support."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonably consistent consistency and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design, and operate highway facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more efficiently food and companions."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "It gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera."}
{"translation": "There were some thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarque claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river."}
{"translation": "The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km wide."}
{"translation": "Not less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from rivers comes from the Amazon."}

{"translation": "All citizens of the Vatican City are Catholic."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, peoples have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also proposed the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don\u2019t forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}

{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms."}

{"translation": "One wonders what the keyboard will become when the next new thing arrives."}
{"translation": "The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a myriad of protons and neutrons."}

{"translation": "It is thinner at the seas and thicker under continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Theories of content focus on what makes people feel good or attractive."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what drives some people to want what they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain the good friend (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager struggles to take unpopular decisions, lead disciplinary actions, carry out evaluations, delegate responsibilities, and hold others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his or her way."}
{"translation": "After all, the head coach is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the team that each member reports to. It sets standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organisation want to impose the time-consuming process of creating an organisation learning structure\u2009? One of the objectives linked to the implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's need."}

{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumors and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science which studies the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims at automating tasks requiring intelligent approaches."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and questions of clients, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on the solution of everyday problems."}
{"translation": "The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been used in several home computer and video game software."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outputs. Students can watch ancient objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Participating practically to an excursion is also an excellent way to think about a trip and to share experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students at Bennet College in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the website is updated, but the older versions are kept online as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try the experience of the blog with a poor grammar and spelling, the fact of having a public usually evolves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"obliges students to better know the world around them\". The need to attract public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs can help students strengthen their analytical and critical thinking abilities: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own points of view on specific topics.\""}
