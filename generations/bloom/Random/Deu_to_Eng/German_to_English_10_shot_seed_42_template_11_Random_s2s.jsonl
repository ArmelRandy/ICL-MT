{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a digestion system like ours to get its needs for amino acids from plants that are not readily available."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you let it go: depression, hunger and eventually death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, although they are eaten."}
