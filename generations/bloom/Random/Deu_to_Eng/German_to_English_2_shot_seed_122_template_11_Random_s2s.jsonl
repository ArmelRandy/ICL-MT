{"translation": "Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide spectrum of ideas in practice, from the technology push or technological imperative to the strict meaning that the human fate is determined by a logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "The majority of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more internal than social."}
{"translation": "It is possible that the person-powered vehicle would bring the development of roads with it."}

{"translation": "So as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His role as the center of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crossroads merchants were able to buy goods such as spices and herbs, which were valued more than the offer of Byzantine markets."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "The clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West are based on the long-distance communication channels of 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "In the Middle Ages Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashion of the times by using buttons to fix their clothing."}

{"translation": "\"These children are called \"\"wild\"\" or \"\"unruly\"\". Some were taken away by their own parents; in some cases the parents were unable to return the child because of the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child.\""}
{"translation": "Wolves may have had massive litters or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other people should be kept away from animals; some should only be kept in the wild."}
{"translation": "If the animals are completely separated from each other, it shows the wild animal's behaviour (in the context of its physical possibilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, for example, its fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real objects can both exist. In other words, a teacher is a form of virtual object, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual labs are built into the software and should be used to ask questions that the students alone may not be able to answer, and explain them."}
{"translation": "Children are being removed from a large number of reasons in care families, and indeed from a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to exploitation."}

{"translation": "There are also serious consequences if you don't do it: depression, hunger and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, so they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast to that, insects (beetles, ants, cockroaches) are not only easy to feed on, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}

{"translation": "Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "The second type of fossil is found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to make a little difference in the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom. If you want to solve the problem, you should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "A few can say that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their children to grow up big."}
{"translation": "This couple can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights to the adoptive parents, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about the experimentation, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}

{"translation": "Why do transportation systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the investigation of the movement of individuals and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some drivers try to behave in a more consistent manner; therefore, traffic lights have a certain consistency and can be mathematically calculated."}
