On the one hand, that technological development itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more internal than social."}
{"translation": "One may be tempted to think that the personal car is not conducive to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically not viable. Therefore, new production methods are developed to reduce the costs of car ownership."}

{"translation": "So as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the center of luxury began about 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the pilgrims were returning with gifts such as seeds and fruits, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between 10-11th and 14th centuries."}

{"translation": "Wolves may have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were allowed to play or left the club."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be shot; some should be left in the wild."}
{"translation": "When the animals are completely separated from each other, it shows the wild animal's behaviour (within its body's possibilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, for example, its fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals in a new learning situation can use, for example, by using a new computer program or by starting a new project."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is very difficult for a primate with a feeding system like that of man to obtain amino acids from plants that have not yet been harvested."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you let it go: depression, hunger and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, so they are not eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to obtain, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}

{"translation": "Second types of fossils are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to make a little difference in the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a more serious problem. If, however, you do not only want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out through the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were well known."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody is aware of the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge construction."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems get into such misunderstandings, why do they get into such a mess? Is it just incompetent drivers? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some drivers are not consistent in their behaviour; therefore, there is a certain consistency in traffic and it can be mathematically described."}
