{"translation": "Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide spectrum of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic that is bound up with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more internal than social."}
{"translation": "It can be assumed that the person-powered vehicle is not conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the center of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the pilgrims were returning with goods such as seeds and fruits, which were valued more highly than the merchandise of Byzantium."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West have been influenced by the long-distance communication channels for 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "In the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use hooks to fix clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture that aims to produce as many foodstuffs as possible so that it meets the needs of the landowner or the landowner's family."}

{"translation": "One of the most important ways to highlight the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who are not socially integrated because of neglect, misfortune or unforeseen abuse during childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are known as \"wild\" or \"wild.\" Some were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to care for the child, due to the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves may have had massive litters or traumatic experiences, before they were abandoned or killed."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should only be kept in the wild."}
{"translation": "If the wild animal is completely isolated from other animals, it shows behavioural patterns (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in agreement with those of its specific prey, such as its fear or its ability to live with humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals can use in a new learning situation such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Food can be virtual or real. With other words, a teacher is a form of food, but also the little boy in Microsoft Office."}

{"translation": "Studies in the 20th century have shown that there are two pools of genetic variation - hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation causes new genetic variations and selection eliminates these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savannah, it is hard for a primate with a feeding system like ours to get its needs for amino acids from plants that are available to it."}
{"translation": "In addition, it has serious consequences if you do not take it up: depression, hunger and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, although they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "As a whole, it should not upset us if our own journeys have caused the \"protein problem\" in the savanna in the same way as it has today."}

{"translation": "Despite the fact that the fences were only made of parallel wooden posts, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the rougher roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Already in the early morning, a lot of effort was put into securing the position of the sheep. But then it turned out that sheep, which carry a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but ironically the steel caused more damage to the rusting rims of the cars."}
{"translation": "Finally, the wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. 1767 were the first fully iron rafts built."}
{"translation": "The first known form of movement was walking. The human began to walk two million years ago with the appearance of the erectus (which means \"upright human\")."}
{"translation": "Your ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "Second species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs before 7 million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to make a little bit of progress in the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a treatment. If, however, you do not only want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "A few people may think that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their children to grow up big."}
{"translation": "This couple can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis for most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Philosophers and natural scientists concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were well known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece."}

{"translation": "Science now knows that this massive coal industry has brought about a major change in the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has been responsible for the human evolution in the last two million years."}
{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody says that transport systems are bad."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they fail to operate regularly? Are transport companies just incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately it is difficult to study traffic flows, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some drivers try to behave in a more consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
