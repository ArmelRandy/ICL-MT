{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has \u201eeffects\u201c on societies, which are rather inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "It can be assumed that the person-powered vehicle is not conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "His role as the center of luxury began roughly 400 years ago and lasted until roughly 1100 years ago."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crossroads were used as markets for goods such as seeds and fruits, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna for a primate with a foraging system like that of a human, his need for amino acids is met by plant-derived resources."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you don't do it: depression, hunger, and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are difficult for primates like us to eat, because they are poisonous."}
{"translation": "In contrast to that, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}

{"translation": "The first fencing clubs were established in England in the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the rails were only made of parallel timber, they allowed the wagons to reach higher speeds and to travel further distances than on the roads of the past."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody criticizes transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge construction."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes on a regular basis? Are transportation officials just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, not all drivers are consistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
