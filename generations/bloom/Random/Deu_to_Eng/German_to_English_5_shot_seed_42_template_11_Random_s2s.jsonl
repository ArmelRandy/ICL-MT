{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, which sprang from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that forms the individuals. With the time came the needs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than willingly imposed laws."}
{"translation": "So as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His luxury as the center of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the pilgrims were returning with goods such as silk and wine, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}

{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "Wolves may have had to deal with massive child abandonments or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or left behind."}
{"translation": "Other people should be fed; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If the animals are completely separated from each other, it shows the wild animal's behaviour (within its physical possibilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, for example, its fear or its ability to avoid humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning can make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals can use in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real can both be. In other words, a teacher is a form of virtual, but also the little boy in Microsoft Office."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a digestion system like ours to get amino acids from plants."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has severe consequences if you don't do it: depression, hunger and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are difficult for primates, such as us, to digest, so they are not eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to grow, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "In an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights over their children to another couple, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}

{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear about the quality of water or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes on a regular basis? Are transport companies just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some car drivers try to behave in a more consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
