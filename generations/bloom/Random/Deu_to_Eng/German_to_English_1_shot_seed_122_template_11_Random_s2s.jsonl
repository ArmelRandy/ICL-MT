{"translation": "A teacher can be both virtual and real. With other words, a teacher is a form of a student, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual hints are built into the software and should be used to ask questions, which the student alone may not be able to answer, and explain them."}

{"translation": "Moreover, it has serious consequences if one does not take it seriously: depression, malnutrition and finally death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, so they are eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the investigation of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
