{"translation": "Wolves may have had to deal with massive litters or traumatic experiences, before they were allowed to reproduce or left the pack."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should be left alone in the wild."}

{"translation": "Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding should go one step further."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, it is for a primate with a digestion system like that of a human being, to be able to obtain amino acids from plants, which are difficult to obtain."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you do not take care of it: depression, lack of food and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are for us very difficult to obtain, because they are poisonous to us."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}
