{"translation": "In fact, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know that it exists. When you entered the cave, you were completely isolated."}
{"translation": "Above, one can only see the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this universe."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the Seven Wonders that still exists today."}
{"translation": "Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many gigantic structures erected in honour of the deceased pharaohs."}
{"translation": "The Giza Plateau, or \"Giza Necropolis\", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the largest being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx."}
{"translation": "The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and the members of his family."}
{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" looks like a V and the symbol \"pull\" looks like a hook or a square with the bottom side missing."}
{"translation": "The top means that you must start by the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means that you must start by the top (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "A bowed string produces a softer sound, while a bowed string produces a stronger and more assertive sound."}
{"translation": "Do not hesitate to write your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the marks of the bow are made for musical reasons and must therefore be respected."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11\u00a0years old, and Louis-Charles, 4\u00a0years old) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who screamed threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen were obliged, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages."}
{"translation": "At one point, a member of the crowd raised the head of a Royal Guardsman killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen."}
{"translation": "The American war expenditures in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest of the obligations issued by the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental benefits of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to their creation."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the generally accepted period of the High Middle Ages \u2013 the period of European history that runs from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "The technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense according to which the destiny of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself is a process that transcends cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive possession of cars also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, with time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "In the same way as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a centre of luxury began about 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D."}
{"translation": "During the 12th century, the status of Cambodia declined mainly because the Crusaders came back loaded with silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th\u201311th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could accuse a delay of 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is an agricultural system that is practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, using locally conserved seeds, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures gather individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender of members."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses modes, manners and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered."}
{"translation": "Wild children might have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals\u2009; some lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "The support is not a learning method but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is a form of support too."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, guide and explain procedures that would have been too difficult for the learner to manage on his or her own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons that range from neglect to abuse, to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but that's the case."}
{"translation": "We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home where they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and gratifications."}
{"translation": "For example, \"learning\" and \"socialization\" are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"personal involvement\" and \"continuous relationships\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the reactions of the public to internet sites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions lasting for a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article \"The President's Speech\", indicated how people with brain damage who cannot understand the speech are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in domestic animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "The twentieth century research has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs of variation\u00a0: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternates between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and ultimately, death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of proteins containing all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process of awakening intentionally during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you wake up without being completely woken up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "The other possibilities based on the biological rhythms include drinking a lot of liquids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and his mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Each person has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is composed of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the universal love path."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The centre of Tibetan meditation is the practice of the deity yoga. It is through visualisation of different deities that channels of energy are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awakening consciousness is created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended their cooperation."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the old allies became enemies and the cold war began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields both in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places."}
{"translation": "The 17\u00a0September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian head of bridge."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet troops arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they invaded the east of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and his goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent and remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to help the British."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, tried to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just as she did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them close to them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the term more commonly known as shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "The \"wagonways\" were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks for wagons were simply wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbars were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it soon became apparent that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a strip of iron on top."}
{"translation": "It has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9\u00a0million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can begin by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 specimens were made, today known as \"Dunlap Broads\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document took place in the hall of the Independence Hall on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap leaves still known to exist are the oldest known copies of the document. The original handwritten manuscript has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many palaeontologists think today that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Very few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They are covered with scales and have claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is coded in binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits for computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of drugs or household chemicals that are toxic."}
{"translation": "Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Red worms, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or the habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to do an adoption project for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights in order for another couple to raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, the experimentation, and an experiment is a test that eliminates one or several of the possible hypotheses, raises questions and makes observations, but also guides scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have concentrated on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, have been accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer"}
{"translation": "The ecotourism is interested in people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities."}
{"translation": "One can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orang-utans of Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transport shuttle, each is in some way connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "The science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone belongs to society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and of the interactions they exert between themselves."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximately."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design, and operate road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more effectively food and companions."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "This gives them more hiding places from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera."}
{"translation": "About a thousand years ago, a man called Aristarque claimed that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river."}

{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since ancient times, peoples are familiar with the basic elements of chemistry such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was the earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also proposed the theory that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}
{"translation": "Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold."}
{"translation": "One can also find alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}

{"translation": "It is thinner at the sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Theories of content are centered on the search for what makes people feel good or attractive."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized over the course of their maturation into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are the Maslow hierarchy of needs theory and the Herzberg two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain the good friend (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time taking unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has created up to now and do things his or her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"team invisible\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The invisible team\" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It establishes standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose the cumbersome process of creating an organizational learning structure\u2009? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's need."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neuro-biological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore reduce the scope of research and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has been known for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain injuries affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning and adaptive behavior of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims at automating tasks requiring an intelligent approach by machines."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and questions of clients, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on the contribution of solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer and video game software."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch ancient objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful artwork while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try the blogging experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, the fact of having a public usually evolves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "\"It also forces students to better understand the world around them.\""}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs can allow students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking abilities: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and present their own views on specific topics.\""}
