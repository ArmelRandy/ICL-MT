{"translation": "Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which human destiny is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself occurs beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive possession of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, with time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a luxury hub began around 400 and lasted until 1100."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that Crusaders came back loaded with silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 13th centuries."}
{"translation": "At first, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture to the east."}
{"translation": "However, because of the slow means of communication, Western modes could lag by 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, using seeds conserved from the ecological region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures gather individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses modes, manners and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \u201cferocious\u201d or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered."}
{"translation": "Wild children might have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some would have been raised by animals\u2009; some would have lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When fully raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners who are discovering a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. That is, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is a form of support too."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that would have been too difficult to manage by the student alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but that's the case."}
{"translation": "We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home where they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and gratification."}
{"translation": "For example, \u2018learning\u2019 and \u2018socialisation\u2019 are considered to be major factors favouring the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\u201cPersonal involvement\u201d and \u201ccontinuous relationships\u201d were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the reactions of the public to internet sites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions for a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article \"The President's Speech\", indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain injuries are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour can be found in domestic animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "The 20th century research showed that there are two genetic reservoirs of variation - hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the plant resources available."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in the same way that chimpanzees do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally awakening during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes)."}

{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other biologically based options include drinking a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which are considered diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension is, the more positive the vital force is. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment."}

{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the practice of the deity. It is through visualizing different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and awakening consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended their cooperation."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields both in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans became obsolete almost immediately, when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after they invaded the east of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans."}
{"translation": "Marine work traditionally has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent and notable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just as she did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them close to them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "\u201cWagonways\u201d were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks for wagons were simply wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbars were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, it soon became apparent that tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a steel strip on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "On finds bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the Speaker of the House John Hancock and the Secretary of the House Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}

{"translation": "They have scales on their legs and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their rear legs like T-Rexes."}
{"translation": "Most computers used today are based on manipulating information that is coded in binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for the computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible."}

{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \u201cinsect\u201d is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduces, just like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The primary purpose of science is to understand how the world works through scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, pose questions and make observations, but also directs scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with a radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism is the interest of people who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, especially the fauna and flora."}

{"translation": "In this dynamic transport shuttle, each person is somehow connected to a system of private car transport and support."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they have with each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonably consistent consistency and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design, and operate highway facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and find more efficiently food and companions."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "It gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera."}
{"translation": "There are a few thousand years ago, an Aristarque claimed that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, doesn't it?"}

{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain the good friend (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time taking unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his or her way."}
{"translation": "After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet at different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \u2018invisible team\u2019 (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \u201cinvisible team\u201d is the management team to which each member reports. It establishes standards for each of them."}

{"translation": "We know for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain injuries affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions."}
{"translation": "The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although artificial intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims to automate tasks requiring intelligent approaches."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face."}

{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the fact of having a public audience usually improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his or her writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"obliges students to better understand the world around them\". The need to attract the public's interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs can allow students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking abilities: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and expose their own points of view on specific topics\" (Oravec, 2002)."}
