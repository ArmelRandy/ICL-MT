{"translation": "The technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the destiny of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself occurs beyond the cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive possession of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography shaped individuals and, with time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was known as the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a centre of luxury began in the fourth century and lasted until the eleventh century."}
{"translation": "Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders came back loaded with presents such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th and 13th centuries."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture to the east."}
{"translation": "However, due to the slowness of communication means, Western modes could accuse a lag of 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is an agricultural practice which is practised to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological, system that uses locally preserved seeds combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures gather individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can differ by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, manners and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that the child suffered."}
{"translation": "Wild children might have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals; some lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "The support is not a learning method but rather a means to help learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is a form of support too."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to question, guide, and explain procedures that would have been too difficult for the learner to manage alone."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons that range from neglect to abuse, to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is."}
{"translation": "We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our foster care placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The placement in a foster home is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home where they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications."}
{"translation": "For example, \"apprenticeship\" and \"socialization\" are considered to be major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\"The personal involvement\" and \"continuous relationships\" have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the reactions of the public to the internet sites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions that last for a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain injuries are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in domestic animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "The twentieth century research has shown that there are two genetic reservoirs of variation - hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in the same way that chimpanzees do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally awakening during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes)."}

{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "Other biologically based options include drinking a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "Lower tension is more positive. Each person has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the universal love path."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The centre of Tibetan meditation is the yogic deity. It is through visualisation of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and awakening consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended their cooperation."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the old allies became enemies and the cold war began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields both in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places."}
{"translation": "On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian head of bridge."}
{"translation": "But those plans were almost obsolete the day after, when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the east of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Marine work traditionally has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent and notable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just as she did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them close to them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "The \"wagonways\" were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks for wagons were simply wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbeams were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, it soon became apparent that tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a steel strip on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can begin by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "During the night, between 150 and 200 were made, today known as \"Dunlap Broadside\"."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the hall of Independence on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap leaves still known to exist are the oldest known copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many palaeontologists think that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Very few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are a lot of things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur."}
{"translation": "They have scales on their legs and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their rear legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Most computers used today are based on the manipulation of binary coded information."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits for using the computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of drugs or household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Consult the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Bedbugs, just like bedbugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well estimate that it is not in their interest, nor in the child's interest, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to do an adoption project for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experience is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, pose questions and make observations, but also directs scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA is a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism is the interest of people who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, especially the fauna and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities."}
{"translation": "One can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover orang-utans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to work and cross other people going to work in the countryside they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation shuttle, each is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act in a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonably consistent structure and can be mathematically approximated."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design and operate road facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more efficiently food and companions."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body."}
{"translation": "This gives them more hiding places from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera."}
{"translation": "There are a few thousand years ago, an man called Aristarque claimed that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river."}

{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City are all Roman Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was earth, water, air, and fire."}
{"translation": "It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also proposed that these states transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}

{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to break with little or no pressure."}
{"translation": "The moon's surface is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the hidden side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner at the sea level and thicker under the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Theories of content are centered on the search for what makes people feel good or attractive."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature toward adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain \"the good friend\" (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has trouble taking unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his or her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a \"real invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "\"The invisible team is the team that each member reports to. It sets the standards for each of them.\""}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose the cumbersome process of creating an organizational learning structure\u2009? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's need."}

{"translation": "We know for a long time that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions."}
{"translation": "The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before."}
{"translation": "This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science which studies the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research is concerned with the automation of tasks requiring intelligent approaches."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer and video game software."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus tour is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is brought about by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at old objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the capital of the state. Each year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students often try the blogging experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, the fact of having a public audience usually evolves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his or her writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "\"Blogging forces students to better understand the world around them. The need to attract public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).\""}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs can allow students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking abilities: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and present their own points of view on specific topics.\" (Oravec, 2002)."}
