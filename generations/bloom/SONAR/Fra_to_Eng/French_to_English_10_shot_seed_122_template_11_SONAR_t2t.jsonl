{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself occurs according to a process that exceeds the cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car."}
{"translation": "The massive possession of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture linked to this geography have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, are preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as the epicentre of luxury began around 400 and lasted until 1100 approximately."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders were returning loaded with silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 13th centuries."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses modes, manners and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability that affected the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children might have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some were raised by animals\u2009; some lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) that are almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a learning method but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching method such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is also."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to query, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage on their own."}

{"translation": "In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition and ultimately, death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" a little bit like the chimpanzees of the savanna do today."}

{"translation": "The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "Marine work traditionally has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent and remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like it did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them close to them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skins."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "The \"wagonways\" were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks for wagons were simply wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day."}
{"translation": "The crossbars were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, it soon became apparent that tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a steel strip on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}

{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that the problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}

{"translation": "Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The term \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very adept at parasitizing humans."}
{"translation": "Reductions, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, meaning adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the child\u2019s interest, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The primary objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that eliminates one or more of the possible hypotheses, poses questions and makes observations, but also directs scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They conducted two experiments to label either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to the death of cells or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism interests people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, especially the fauna and flora."}

{"translation": "In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and support."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between each other."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act in a fairly consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a fairly consistent pattern and can be approximated mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design, and operate highway facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from their enemies and to find more easily food and companions."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "It gives them more hiding places from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera."}
{"translation": "About a thousand years ago, a man named Aristarque claimed that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars)."}

{"translation": "There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Theories of content focus on what makes people feel good or attractive."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature towards adulthood."}

{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain the good friend (or good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time making impopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his or her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \u2018invisible team\u2019 (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets standards for each of them."}

{"translation": "This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science which studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research is concerned with the automation of tasks requiring intelligent approaches."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of writing, voice and face."}
