{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that are available to them."}
{"translation": "Also, it has serious consequences if you let it happen: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
