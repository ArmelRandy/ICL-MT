{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was developed by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that is important. The people who formed it. With the passage of time, customs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and this, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the centre of luxury began around 400 B.C. and lasted until around 1100 B.C."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as bones and ivory, were returned to their original owners, who valued them more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West depend on the length of communication channels 25-30 years ago."}
{"translation": "In the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use clasps to fix their clothing."}

Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases the parents were forced to accept the child's uncontrollable behavior, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other people should be treated like animals; some should be left alone in the wild."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if one neglects: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "As a whole, it should not upset us if our own ancestors' protein problems were solved in a similar way as it is solved by the chimpanzees in the savanna today."}

Animals such as sheep and goats were used to tread the fields, just like the well-known sheepherders; often the children or grandchildren were involved. This farming method is still practised today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built railways."}
{"translation": "Though the wheels were only supported by parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses, which pulled the wagons, to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of earlier times."}
{"translation": "Already in the early morning, wooden planks were laid to protect the position of the horses. But as the knowledge spread that horses that carry a band of steel are more efficient, the practice was abandoned."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron made it easier for the wheels to slide over the rough ground."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767, the first complete iron rafts were introduced."}

{"translation": "Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "Second species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs by seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help lessen the future burden."}

{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they make them on a regular basis? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
