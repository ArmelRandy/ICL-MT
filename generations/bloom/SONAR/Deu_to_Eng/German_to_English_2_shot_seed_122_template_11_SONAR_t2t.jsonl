{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His luxury as the center of luxury began about 400 n. Chr. and lasted until about 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as coins and jewellery, were valued more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine market."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to care for the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other people should not be exposed to animals; some should only live in the wild."}

{"translation": "The easiest to access food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast to this, animal food sources (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to obtain, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "In sum, it should not surprise us if our own travels have helped to solve the protein problem in the savanna today, just as it has helped to solve the protein problem in the Galapagos."}

The animals were kept in enclosures, similar to the well-known horse enclosures; often the children or the animals themselves were involved. This method of keeping animals is still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England built foundations."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the wheels were mainly made of parallel strips of wood, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the roads of earlier times."}
{"translation": "Already in the early days, wells were dug to protect the position of the trenches. But after a while it became clear that trenches, which were made of steel, were more efficient."}

{"translation": "Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "The second type is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can support the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, in order to make a little difference in the future."}
{"translation": "This is just like a symptomatic treatment. If, however, you do not only want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge, the West lost its philosophical and scientific knowledge in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often the main part of the phenomenon due to the presence of peripheral rhythms and their production by biological oscillators.x"}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody is aware of transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they happen regularly? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, most drivers are not consistent in their behaviour; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
{"translation": "To improve traffic flow, the connections between the three most important features were defined: (1) River, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating institutions on the railways."}
