{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Some people should be kept away from animals; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has severe consequences if one neglects it: depression, hunger and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built railways."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the wheels were only supported by parallel wooden planks, they allowed the chariots to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of earlier times."}
{"translation": "Already in the early morning, wooden planks were laid to protect the position of the horses. But as the knowledge spread that horses that carry a band of iron are more efficient, the practice was abandoned."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron made the wheels more prone to wear on the hardened rims."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767, the first fully iron rafts were introduced."}
