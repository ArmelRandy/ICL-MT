{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was fostered by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that forms the individuals. With the time, the customs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and this, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than the willfully imposed laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the centre of luxury began about 400 years BC and lasted until about 1100 years BC."}
{"translation": "Its status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross-religionists were returning with gifts such as silk and gold, which were valued more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, styles in the West depend on the length of communication lines 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashion of the times by using buttons to fix their clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture that aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his/her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological building method that uses locally available, in the boreal region, permafrost soil and with the help of traditional farming or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize the harvest."}
{"translation": "In the past most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common ways to highlight the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who are not socially integrated because of neglect, misfortune or unintentional abuse during childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"wild\". Some wild children were taken from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases the kidnapping of the child was due to the inability of the parents to care for the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should only be kept in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been removed from the wild, it shows the wild animal's behaviour (within its body's possibilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, for example, its fear or its ability to fight."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals are supported in a new learning situation such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Food can either be virtual or real. With other words, a teacher is a form of food, but also the small clown in Microsoft Office."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources."}
{"translation": "It also has severe consequences if you don't take it up: depression, lack of food and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for us to digest, even though they are eaten by primates like us."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "As a whole, it should not upset us if our own journeys have caused the \"protein problem\" in the same way as the chimpanzees in the savanna today."}

{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient method for transporting large amounts of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The main task of the Navy was to ensure that a country remained in a position to provide people and goods, and at the same time to prevent the enemy from providing people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring supplies and troops over the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to keep this trade mostly with submarines."}
{"translation": "The Allies were defeated, so Germany could probably have ruled Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "Cattle were probably domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in the Middle East around 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep animals as food, so that they could easily get milk, meat, and fodder."}
{"translation": "Houses were normally kept in fields, which were surrounded by hedges or other fences. The fences were made of woven wire, similar to the well-known sheep fences; often the children or the animals were involved. This method of fencing is still used today."}
{"translation": "In England, lenses were first made in the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the forks were mainly made of parallel wooden beams, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the rougher roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Already in the early days, steps were laid to protect the position of the horses. However, it soon became clear that horses, which carry a band of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron made the wheels more resistant to the abrasion of the road."}
{"translation": "Finally, the wooden rails were replaced by iron rails. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known locomotion art was walking. The human began to walk upright (which means \"upright human\") two million years ago."}
{"translation": "Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "Second species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can support the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help lessen the burden of the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just symptomatic treatment. However, if you do not want only temporary solutions, we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "Research has shown that the risk of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A few may feel that it is not in their own interests or in the interests of their children to grow up big."}
{"translation": "These parents can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the legal parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out through the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were well known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge the West lost its philosophical and scientific interests in Greece."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody talks about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they happen so often? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental wrong?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unluckily, some drivers try to be consistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
{"translation": "To improve the traffic flow, the connections between the three most important features were defined: (1) River, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating facilities on the railways."}
