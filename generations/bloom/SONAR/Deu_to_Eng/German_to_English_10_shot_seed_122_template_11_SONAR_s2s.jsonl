{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was fostered by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography, the individuals. With the passage of time, customs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and this, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His power as the centre of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 B.C."}
{"translation": "Its status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the pilgrims returned with gifts such as silk and grain, which were valued more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "Nevertheless, styles in the West depend on the length of communication lines 25 to 30 years ago."}

{"translation": "Wolves might have had massive child abuse experiences or traumatic experiences, before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other people should be kept away from animals; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been removed from the wild, it shows the wild animal's behavioral repertoire (within its physical capabilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the repertoire of its specific prey, for example, its fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals are supported in a new learning situation such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that are available to humans."}
{"translation": "It also has severe consequences if one neglects: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast to that, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built support poles."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the forks were only made of parallel planks, they allowed the waggons to travel at higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of earlier times."}
{"translation": "Already in the early days, steps were laid to protect the position of the riders. However, it soon became clear that riders, who carry a band of iron, are more efficient."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unluckily, some car drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
