{"translation": "The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that technological development itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has \u201eeffects\u201c on societies that are rather inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One can probably assume that the person-powered vehicle is not conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the centre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders were returning with goods such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West depend on the length of communication lines 25 to 30 years later."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashion of the times by using buttons to fasten their clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his/her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological building method, which uses locally available, in the boreal region, permafrost soil and with agriculture or other relatively simple techniques, to maximise production."}

{"translation": "One of the most important methods to highlight the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate children who are not socially integrated because of neglect, misfortune or unforeseen misuse during childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"wild.\" Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases the kidnapping of the child was due to the inability of the parents to care for the child due to the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other people should be kept away from animals; some should only be kept in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been domesticated, the wild animal shows behavioral variants (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in agreement with those of its specific breed, such as its fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals are supported in a new learning situation, for example by using a new computer program or starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Food can be virtual or real. A teacher is a form of food, but also the little chocolate man in Microsoft Office."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that produce them."}
{"translation": "In addition, it has serious consequences if one neglects: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they can eat them."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also contain large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

The animals were kept in enclosures similar to the well-known sheep enclosures; often the children or the animals themselves were involved. This method of keeping animals is still used today."}
{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built windmills."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the wheels were only made of parallel strips of wood, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on roads that were not as steep."}
{"translation": "Already in the Middle Ages, steps were built to protect the position of the steps. However, it was discovered that steps, which are made of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron made the wheels more slippery."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767, the first fully iron rafts were introduced."}

{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can support the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to a certain extent, to lessen the burden of the future."}
{"translation": "This is, however, only a symptomatic treatment. If you, however, do not only want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A few may feel that it is not in their own interests or in the interests of their children to grow up big."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the legal parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out through the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were well known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge, the West lost its philosophical and scientific knowledge in Greece."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody knows about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear many complaints about the water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they happen so often? Are traffic controllers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, most drivers are not consistent in their behaviour; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modelled."}
