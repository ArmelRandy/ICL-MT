{"translation": "Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which was fostered by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that matters. The individuals formed by it. With the passage of time, customs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and this, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His luxury as the center of luxury began around 400 B.C. and lasted until around 1100 B.C."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as coins and jewels, were being returned to their original owners, who valued them more than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West are influenced by the long-distance communication channels 25 to 30 years later."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation by an unchanging and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods to highlight the importance of socialisation is to support the few unfortunate children who have suffered from neglect, misfortune or unintentional abuse during their childhood and who have not been socialised by their parents."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"out of control\". Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases the parents were punished for not being able to control their children, who had serious intellectual or physical disabilities."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other people should be kept away from animals; some should only be kept in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been completely domesticated, the wild animal shows behavioral variants (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in agreement with those of its specialized breeds, such as its fear or tolerance of humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals are supported in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}

{"translation": "Studies in the twentieth century have shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection eliminates these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is difficult for them to obtain amino acids from plants that are in short supply."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if one neglects it: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built foundations."}
{"translation": "Although the axle supports were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on roads of the previous time."}
{"translation": "Already in the early days, steps were installed to protect the position of the skaters. However, as the knowledge grew, it became clear that skaters who carry a band of steel are more efficient."}

{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, most drivers are not consistent in their behavior; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modelled."}
