{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than social determined."}
{"translation": "It is possible that the person-powered vehicle will bring about the development of roads in an unforeseeable way."}

{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the center of luxury began around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as bones and teeth, were returned to the churches, which valued them more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "At the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashion of the times by using buttons to fasten their clothes."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture that aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his/her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological building method, which uses locally available, in the boreal region, hardwood timber and other relatively simple techniques to maximize the harvest."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"wild\". Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to care for the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Some animals should be kept in captivity; some should be left in the wild."}

{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals are supported in a new learning situation such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Students can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of student, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual assistants are built into the software and should be used by students who may not be able to perform certain tasks alone, to ask questions, to help and to explain."}
{"translation": "Children are often taken into care by a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even to exploitation."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a foraging system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that are readily available."}
{"translation": "Moreover, it has serious consequences if one does not take it up: depression, lack of food and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had started to build mirrors."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the wheels were made of parallel strips of wood, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry greater loads than on the roads of earlier times."}

{"translation": "Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "The second type is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can support the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to a certain extent, to lessen the burden of the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a problem. If you want to solve the problem, then we should find the root cause and treat it."}

{"translation": "In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main objective of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by the formulation of questions and the conduct of observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were well known."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody is aware of the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes every day? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is there something deeper going on here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically described."}
