{"translation": "The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that technological development itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "One could say that the person-powered vehicle is not conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the center of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as coins and jewellery, were being returned to their original owners, who valued them more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West depend on the length of communication channels 25 to 30 years later."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashion of the times by using pins to fix their clothes."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner and his or her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, often biological building method, which uses locally available, in the arctic region, permafrost soil and with other relatively simple techniques, to maximize the harvest."}
{"translation": "In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers and in many developing countries this is still the case."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"wild.\" Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to care for the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other people should be kept away from animals; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When all animals have been domesticated, the wild animal shows behavioural variants (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely in agreement with those of its specific breed, for example, its fear or its ability to live with humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals are supported in a new learning situation, for example, by using a new computer program or by starting a new project."}
{"translation": "Food can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of food, but also the small clown in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual labs are built into software and should be used to ask questions that a student alone may not be able to answer, and explain them."}
{"translation": "Children are often placed in care because of a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to exploitation."}
{"translation": "No child should be forced to live in an environment that is not safe, loving and educational, but many are."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that are available to humans."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if one does not deal with it: depression, lack of energy and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to reach food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food sources (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "In summary, it should not upset us if our own travels have helped to solve the \"protein problem\" in the savanna just as the chimpanzees do today."}

{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (awakening energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "In the center of Tibetan meditation is the G\u00f6tter-Yoga. Through visualization of different gods the energy channels are connected, the chakras open and the enlightened consciousness arises."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England had built windmills."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the chariot tracks were mainly made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses, which were pulled by the wagons, to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Already in the Middle Ages, steps were laid to protect the position of the sledges. However, the knowledge was gradually gained that sledges, which are made of iron, are more efficient."}

{"translation": "Two species of Australopithecus have been found in fossil remains dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can support the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to a certain extent, to lessen the burden of the future."}
{"translation": "This is, however, a symptomatic treatment. If you want, however, not only temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A few may feel that it is not in their own interests or in the interests of their children to grow a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the legal parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by setting questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge, the West lost its philosophical and scientific knowledge in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior depend on the presence of peripheral oscillators and their production by biological oscillators.x"}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody is aware of the transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they fail regularly? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Fortunately, some drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modelled."}
{"translation": "To improve the traffic flow, the connections between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the railway."}
