{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "However, styles in the West have lagged behind communication channels for 25-30 years."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is difficult for a primate with a feeding system like ours to obtain amino acids from plants that are in short supply."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you do not: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, because they are eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}

{"translation": "Second species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to make a little bit of progress."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a treatment. If you however do not only want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis for most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody talks about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the condition of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes on a regular basis? Are transportation companies just incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, most drivers try to behave in a consistent manner; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modeled."}
