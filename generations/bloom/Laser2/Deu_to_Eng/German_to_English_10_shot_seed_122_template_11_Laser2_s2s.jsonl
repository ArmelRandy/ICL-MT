{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His luxurious lifestyle began around 400 B.C. and lasted until around 1100 B.C."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crusaders were returning with goods such as silk and wine, which were valued more highly than the goods of Byzantium."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "One of the most important ways to highlight the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized due to neglect, misfortune or unintentional abuse during childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"out of control\". Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases the parents' refusal to take care of the child was due to the child's intellectual or physical disabilities."}
{"translation": "Wolves may have had to deal with massive infanticide or traumatic experiences before they were killed or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Some people should be allowed to be petted by animals; some should be allowed to live in the wild."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna for a primate with a foraging system similar to that of humans, it is very difficult for them to obtain amino acids from plants that are available to them."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you do not: depression, malnutrition and eventually death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast to this, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also contain large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
{"translation": "In summary, it should not upset us if our own ancestors had the same protein problem as the savanna animals today."}

{"translation": "A few may feel that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to grow up."}
{"translation": "These couples might decide to adopt a baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the legal parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}

{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the condition of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes regularly? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or does something fundamental go wrong?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Most drivers try to behave in a consistent manner, so there is a certain consistency in traffic and it can be mathematically modeled."}
