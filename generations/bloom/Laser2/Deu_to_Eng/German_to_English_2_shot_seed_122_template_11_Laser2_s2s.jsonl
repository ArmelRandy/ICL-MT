{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His rule as the center of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 B.C."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross-religionists were rewarded with goods such as silk and wine, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}

{"translation": "Wolves may have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were used or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should be left in the wild."}

{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding should go one step further."}

{"translation": "It also has serious consequences if you do not stop: depression, malnutrition and finally death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, terrestrial food sources (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all the essential amino acids contain."}
{"translation": "In summary, it should not upset us if our own ancestors solved the \"protein problem\" in a similar way as it is solved today in the savanna."}

{"translation": "Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this special gift."}
{"translation": "The term \"worm\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group."}
{"translation": "This word is derived from the ancient practice of keeping chickens in the house. These are insects that are very adaptable to living with humans, and can easily parasitize them."}

{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes on a regular basis? Are traffic engineers just incompetent? Or is there something fundamental here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with a hundred percent certainty."}
