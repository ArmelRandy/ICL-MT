{"translation": "The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that technological development itself follows a path which is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies which are rather inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "It can be assumed that the person-powered vehicle is not conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "Its status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as seeds and fruits, which were regarded as valuable as the offerings of Byzantine merchants, were collected."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital also moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West have been influenced by long-distance communication channels for 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "In the Middle Ages Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to follow the fashions as a result of the fashions."}
{"translation": "Economy is agriculture, which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the landowner or landowner and his/her family."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"wild\". Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to take care of the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves may have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Some should be killed by animals; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If it is completely free of animals, it shows the wild child behaviour (within its physical capabilities), which is almost completely in agreement with the behaviour of its specific prey, such as its fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that helps individuals in a new learning situation, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real worlds can both exist. In other words, a teacher is a form of virtual world, but also the little boy in Microsoft Office."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is for a primate with a feeding system like the human\u2019s, to have to rely on plant-derived amino acids."}
{"translation": "Moreover, it has serious consequences if one neglects: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, terrestrial food sources (meats, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also contain large amounts of essential amino acids, which all humans need."}

{"translation": "Already in the early stages of the war submarines were used to protect the position of convoys. However, as the knowledge of the convoys increased, it became clear that ships carrying a steel band are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron provided more protection against the sharp edges of the wagons."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767 the first iron rafts were introduced."}

{"translation": "Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "Second species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been on two legs by seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to a small extent, to lessen future pain."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom treatment. If you still want to solve the problem, we should find the root cause and treat it."}

{"translation": "See the label for specific first aid instructions for this special gift."}
{"translation": "The term \u201eworm\u201c is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group."}

{"translation": "A few may feel that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to grow a baby."}
{"translation": "This couple may decide to adopt their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the parents' legal rights are transferred to the adoptive parents, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some drivers tend to behave inconsistently; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
