{"translation": "Wolves may have suffered massive childbirth or traumatic experiences before being killed or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other people should be fed by animals; some should live alone in the wild."}

{"translation": "In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the condition of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such mistakes, why do they make mistakes regularly? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
