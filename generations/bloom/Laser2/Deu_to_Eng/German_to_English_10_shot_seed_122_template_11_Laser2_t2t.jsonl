Some wild children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to take care of the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves may have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were used or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Some should be killed; some should be left alone in the wild."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna for a primate with a foraging system similar to that of humans, it is very difficult for them to obtain amino acids from plants that are in short supply."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if one does not take it up: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, even though they can be eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, terrestrial food sources (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also contain large amounts of essential amino acids, which all humans require."}

{"translation": "Research has shown that the risk of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A few may feel that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to grow up too quickly."}
{"translation": "These couples may decide to adopt their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the legal parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main goal of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis for most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about experimenting, where an experiment is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody talks about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, you are unlikely to hear many complaints about water quality or the condition of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems get into such problems, why do they break down regularly? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental wrong?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individuals and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, most drivers tend to be inconsistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
