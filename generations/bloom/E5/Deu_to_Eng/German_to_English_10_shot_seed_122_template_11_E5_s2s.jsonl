{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as seeds and herbs, which were considered to be more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine market, were returned."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "Wolves might have had massive litters or traumatic experiences before they were killed or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of man, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that are available to him."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you let it happen: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible food resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
