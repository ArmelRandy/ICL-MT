{"translation": "His luxury as the center of luxury began about 400 n. Chr. and lasted until about 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as coins and jewels, were returned to the Byzantine market, which valued them more highly than the offerings of the ancient monuments."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}

Some of them were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to take care of the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or left."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a foraging system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that are readily available."}
{"translation": "Moreover, it has serious consequences if it is left untreated: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, because they are eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "In an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights to the adoptive parents, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the investigation of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is very difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some car drivers try to be consistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
