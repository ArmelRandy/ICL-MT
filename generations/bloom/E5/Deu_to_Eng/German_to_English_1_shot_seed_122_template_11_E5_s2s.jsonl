On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "It may be possible to say that the person-power car is unusually conducive to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began slowly to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use clasps to fix their clothing."}

{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, so we have to eat them raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "Two-handed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone on two legs before seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to make a little bit of progress."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a problem. If you still want to solve the problem, we should find the root cause and treat it."}

{"translation": "In an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights to the adoptive parents, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}

{"translation": "In developing countries, you rarely hear many complaints about water quality or bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems get into such mistakes, why do they make mistakes on a regular basis? Are traffic controllers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental about it?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some drivers are not consistent in their behaviour; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}

{"translation": "In general, there can be two ways of dealing with this situation, when managers start to train their former colleagues. The first end of the spectrum is the attempt to keep one of the young people (or one of the girls) in the team."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems, unpopular decisions to make, disciplinary measures to implement, performance evaluations to conduct, responsibilities to assign and employees to take on the duty."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, we become an individual who has to do everything differently than the team has done it and has to do everything for himself."}
{"translation": "Finally, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
