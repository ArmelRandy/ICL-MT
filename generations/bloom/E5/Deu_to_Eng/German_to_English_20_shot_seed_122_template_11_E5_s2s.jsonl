{"translation": "The Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which sprang from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that matters. The individuals formed it. With the passage of time, customs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and this, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than would have been the case had they been imposed by force."}
{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His role as the centre of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crossbowmen were rewarded with goods such as seeds and fruits, which were considered to be more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West depend on the length of the communication channels 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to slowly develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use clasps to fix clothing."}
{"translation": "Food production is agriculture which aims to produce as many foodstuffs as possible, so that it meets the needs of the landowner or landowner and his/her family."}
{"translation": "The subsistence economy is a simple, sometimes biological building method, which uses locally available, in a humid climate, natural resources and with simple techniques, to maximise production."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"verwildert\". Some were taken away by their own parents; in some cases, the parents' refusal to return the child to the custody of the authorities was due to the child's inability to accept the parents' disabilities, such as intellectual or physical disabilities."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were used or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of humans, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants that are available to humans."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you do not do it: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, not all drivers are consistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modeled."}
