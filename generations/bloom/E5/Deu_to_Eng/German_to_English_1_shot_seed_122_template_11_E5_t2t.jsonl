{"translation": "So as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "The center of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the pilgrims were returning with gifts such as silk and gold, which were valued more highly than the offerings of Byzantine art."}
{"translation": "At this time the title of the fashion capital of the world was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century."}

Some of them were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to care for the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences, before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals in a new learning situation are supported, for example, by the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Virtual and real objects can both exist. In other words, a teacher is a form of a virtual object, but also the small boy in Microsoft Office."}
{"translation": "Virtual simulations are built into the software and should be tasks that the students alone may not be able to solve, ask for help and explain."}
{"translation": "Children are taken into care from a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to physical abuse to psychological abuse."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a foraging system like that of man, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plants, which are the main source of these nutrients."}
{"translation": "Moreover, it has serious consequences if it is left untreated: depression, malnutrition and finally death."}
{"translation": "The easiest to access plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to eat, because they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the condition of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such misunderstandings, why do they cause traffic jams? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
