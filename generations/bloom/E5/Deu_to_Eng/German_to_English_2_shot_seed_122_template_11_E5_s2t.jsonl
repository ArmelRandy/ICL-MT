{"translation": "As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His reign as the centre of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crossroads merchants were able to buy goods such as spices and herbs, which were valued more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"wild\" or \"verwildert\". Some of them were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the inability of the parents to take care of the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should be left alone in the wild."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of man, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you do not take it up: depression, hunger and finally death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, because they are cooked."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal food (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all essential amino acids contain."}
