{"translation": "Most of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more internal than social."}
{"translation": "It could be argued that the person-powered vehicle is unlikely to contribute to the development of roads."}

{"translation": "The Romanticism had a strong, cultural deterministic element, which sprang from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography, the individuals. With the passage of time, customs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and this, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than would have been expected by law."}
{"translation": "Just like Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "His reign as the centre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crossroads traders were returning with goods such as seeds and fruits, which were valued more highly than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, the styles in the West are based on the long communication lines of 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use knots to fix clothing."}

{"translation": "Members of a subculture signal their affiliation often through an unchanging and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon."}
{"translation": "One of the most important ways to highlight the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who are not socially integrated because of neglect, misfortune or unintentional abuse during childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"verwildert\" or wild. Some were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the kidnapping of the child was due to the inability of the parents to cope with the extraordinary intellectual or physical limitations of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a digestive system like ours, it is very difficult to get amino acids from plants that are available to them."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you let it happen: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they can be eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast to this, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which contain all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "As a whole, it should not upset us if our ancestors' protein problems were similar to those of the chimpanzees in the savanna today."}

{"translation": "One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring supplies and troops over the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to block this traffic mainly with U-Boats."}
{"translation": "The Allies were defeated, so Germany could probably rule Britain just like the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It is believed that sheep were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep animals as food, so that they could easily get milk, meat, and fodder."}

{"translation": "Already in the 16th century, people in England built support poles."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the forks were only made of parallel wooden beams, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on roads of the past."}
{"translation": "Already in ancient times, wheels were used to keep track of the position of the chariots. However, it was discovered that chariots that carried a band of iron were more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron made the wheels more slippery."}
{"translation": "Finally, the wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767 the first iron rafts were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known locomotion art was walking. The human began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means \"upright human\")."}
{"translation": "Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, didn't walk so regularly."}

{"translation": "A few people may think that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their children to grow a baby to adulthood."}
{"translation": "This couple can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "With an adoption, the biological parents give their parental rights to another couple, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific studies."}
{"translation": "However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that aims to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}

{"translation": "In developing countries, you are far less likely to hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such problems, why do they fail so often? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental wrong?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study traffic flows, because we can't be sure that drivers behave with a hundred percent safety."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, not all drivers are consistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modeled."}

{"translation": "Today, only insects that do not have wings can fly backwards."}
{"translation": "About a thousand years ago, a man named Aristarch said that the Sun is in the middle of the movements of the solar system."}

{"translation": "Sharing an excursion online is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
