{"translation": "Its luxury centre began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as seeds and herbs, which were considered to be more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine market, were returned."}

{"translation": "Wolves may have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other animals should be killed; some should only be kept in the wild."}

{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a locomotion system like that of man, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you let it happen: depression, lack of food and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for primates like us to digest, because they are eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}

{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement and we can even become activists to make a little difference in the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom treatment. If you want to go beyond temporary solutions, we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, some car owners tend to behave inconsistently; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically represented."}
