{"translation": "Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide spectrum of ideas in practice, from the technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that the human fate is determined by a logic that is bound to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general assumptions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has effects on societies that are more inherent than socially determined."}
{"translation": "It is possible to assume that the personal mobility vehicle has a negative impact on the development of roads."}

{"translation": "In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that matters. The individuals formed it. With the time came the needs and cultures that were in harmony with this geography and this, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than the willfully imposed laws."}
{"translation": "So as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so was Constantinople the fashion capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its centre of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the cross relics, such as coins and jewellery, were returned to their owners, who valued them more highly than the offerings of Byzantine merchants."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}
{"translation": "At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east."}
{"translation": "However, styles in the West are based on the long-distance communication channels of 25 to 30 years ago."}
{"translation": "In the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fix their clothing."}

{"translation": "One of the most important ways to increase the importance of socialization is to support the few unfortunate cases of children who are not socially integrated because of neglect, misfortune or unintentional abuse during childhood."}
{"translation": "Such children are called \"verwildert\" or wild. Some of them were taken into custody by their own parents; in some cases, the custody of the child was based on the inability of the parents to take care of the child, the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were adopted or abandoned."}
{"translation": "Other people should be treated like animals; some should be left alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "If the environment is completely devoid of animals, it shows the wild child behaviors (within his body's possibilities), which are almost completely in agreement with those of his specific prey species, for example, his fear or tolerance towards humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based learning makes the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further."}
{"translation": "Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that individuals in a new learning situation is supported, for example, by the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project."}

{"translation": "Mutation results in new genetic variations and selection eliminates these from the pool of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with every generation."}
{"translation": "Out in the savanna it is hard for a primate with a foraging system like that of humans to get enough amino acids from plants to meet its needs."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has severe consequences if you do not take it: depression, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, because they are eaten raw."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of nutrients, which all essential amino acids contain."}

{"translation": "The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient method for transporting large amounts of people and goods across the oceans."}
{"translation": "The task of the Marine was traditionally to ensure that a country was in a position to provide people and goods, and at the same time to prevent the enemy from providing people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring supplies and troops over the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy tried to block the invasion mainly with U-Boats."}
{"translation": "Because the allies were defeated, Germany could probably have ruled the rest of Europe just as well as Britain."}
{"translation": "Cattle were probably domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in the Middle East about 10,000 years ago."}
{"translation": "Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep animals as food sources, so that they could easily get milk, meat, and fodder."}
{"translation": "Houses were normally kept in the woods, which were often connected to other forested areas. Trees were often felled to provide timber for houses. This practice is still used today."}
{"translation": "In England, the first forerunner of the modern motorway was built in the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the forks were mainly made of parallel wood bristles, they allowed the wagons to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the roads of earlier times."}
{"translation": "Already in the early 1900s, wheels were used to keep track of the position of the trains. However, it was soon discovered that trains that carried a steel band were more efficient."}

{"translation": "Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, didn't walk so regularly."}
{"translation": "Two-legged species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can stop the environmental movement, and we can even become activists, to make a little difference in the future."}
{"translation": "This is often just a symptom of a treatment. If, however, you do not only want temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it."}

{"translation": "Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for this special gift."}
{"translation": "The word \u201eworm\u201c is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group."}
{"translation": "This word is derived from the ancient belief that bedbugs are insects that are very adaptable. They can easily adapt to humans."}
{"translation": "Both raiding ants as well as building ants are nidicolous, i.e. living in the nest or the building of their nests."}
{"translation": "In the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}

{"translation": "Studies have shown that the risk of developing MS is twice as high in women as in men."}
{"translation": "A few might say that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their children to have a baby grow up."}
{"translation": "These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby."}
{"translation": "In an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights to another couple, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}
{"translation": "However, it is not only about the experimentation, which is a test, which aims to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. The scientific research is also carried out by asking questions and conducting observations."}
{"translation": "Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin language."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were known."}
{"translation": "With the loss of Greek knowledge the West lost its philosophical and scientific interests in Greece."}
{"translation": "Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior depend on the presence of motor neurons and their production by biological oscillators.x"}
{"translation": "From a cyclical event certain actions, which are not only reactions to external stimuli, are known in most living things, also in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}

{"translation": "Everybody takes part in the society and uses transport systems. Almost everybody talks about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developing countries you rarely hear about the water quality or the construction of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transport systems cause such misunderstandings, why do they cause traffic jams? Are traffic engineers incompetent? Or is there something fundamental here?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions, which occur between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, most car drivers are not consistent; therefore, traffic jams have a certain consistency and can be mathematically modeled."}
{"translation": "To improve the traffic flow, the connections between the three most important features were defined: (1) River, (2) Density and (3) Speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help in planning, designing and operating railway stations."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to reach the heavens. Their ability to fly made them easier to avoid enemies and more efficient in finding food and mates."}
{"translation": "Most insects can close their wings around their bodies."}

{"translation": "In general, there are two ways to handle this situation: either the manager starts to train his/her former colleagues, or he/she tries to keep one of the youngsters (or one of the girls) in the team."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has problems, making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and taking on the duties of others."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum we become an individual that is not recognisable anymore, which has to do everything differently than the team did and has to do everything on its own."}

{"translation": "KI is strongly associated with science fiction, but it is a very important part of computer science, which is concerned with behaviour, learning and intelligent modification of machines."}
{"translation": "Research in the field of KI focuses on the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior."}
{"translation": "Examples for this are steering, setting up strategies and plans, the ability to diagnose and answer questions, handwriting, speech and face recognition."}
{"translation": "Such things are associated with certain disciplines, which concentrate on finding solutions to problems of everyday life."}
{"translation": "The KI system is today used frequently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and is also used in a number of software applications for home computers and video games."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an important part of every class. Not often would a teacher invite her students and students to places where a bus ride is not an option."}
