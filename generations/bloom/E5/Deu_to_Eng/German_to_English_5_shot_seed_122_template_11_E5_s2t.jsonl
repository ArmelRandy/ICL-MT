{"translation": "Its center of luxury began around 400 n. Chr. and lasted until around 1100 n. Chr."}
{"translation": "His status declined in the course of the twelfth century, which was mainly due to the fact that the crossroads traders with spices and other goods, which were valued more than the offerings of the Byzantine merchants, were returning."}
{"translation": "At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its peak in the time between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century."}

{"translation": "Such children are called \"verwildert\" or wild. Some verwildert children were taken away from their parents (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the kidnapping of the child was due to the inability of the parents to take care of the child, due to the extreme intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."}
{"translation": "Wolves might have had to deal with massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were released or killed."}
{"translation": "Other people should be kept away from animals; some should be kept alone in the wild."}

{"translation": "Out in the savanna, for a primate with a digestive system like that of man, it is very difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources."}
{"translation": "Besides, it has serious consequences if you don't take it up: depression, hunger and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The easily accessible food resources were protein in leaves and fruits, but these are hard for us to digest, even though they are eaten by primates like us."}

{"translation": "At the same time the German Navy tried to block this traffic mainly with U-Boats."}
{"translation": "The Allies were defeated, so Germany probably could have ruled Britain just as well as the rest of Europe."}

{"translation": "In England, telescopes were first built in the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Despite the fact that the forks were mainly made of parallel wood bristles, they allowed the wagons to travel at higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the roads of earlier times."}
{"translation": "Spokes were already used to keep the position of the wheels. But after and after that, the knowledge was discovered that wheels, which are made of iron, are more efficient."}
{"translation": "This was common, but iron was better for preventing rust on the rims of the wheels."}
{"translation": "Finally, the wooden rafts were replaced by iron rafts. In 1767, the first fully iron rafts were introduced."}
{"translation": "The first known locomotion art was walking. The human began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means \"upright human\")."}

{"translation": "With an adoption, the legal parents give their parental rights to another couple, so that another couple can take over the parental rights."}
{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works. This method is the basis of most scientific investigations."}

{"translation": "Sharing an excursion online is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes."}
{"translation": "For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website each year about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is created each year, but the original versions remain online and are used as a collection album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also be used to improve the writing skills of students. However, students at the beginning of their blogging experience often have a poor grammar and spelling, but this improves over time, if there is a public audience."}
