{"translation": "The easiest to obtain plant resources were proteins in leaves and fruits, but these are hard to digest for primates like us, even though they are eaten."}
{"translation": "In contrast, animal foodstuffs (meat, insects, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of essential amino acids, which all animals need."}
