{"translation": "The symbol \"push\" looks like a V and the symbol \"pull\" looks like a clasp or a square with the bottom side missing."}
{"translation": "The top means you must start at the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you must start at the top (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow."}
{"translation": "A higher arch produces a softer sound, while a lower arch is stronger and more assertive."}
{"translation": "Do not hesitate to write your own marks on the sheet, but do not forget that the marks of the bow are printed for musical reasons and must therefore be respected."}
{"translation": "On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, 11\u00a0years old, and Louis-Charles, 4\u00a0years old) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vendors."}
{"translation": "In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats against the king and queen."}
{"translation": "The king and queen were obliged, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages."}
{"translation": "At some point, a member of the crowd raised the head of a fallen royal guard before the terrified queen."}
{"translation": "The US military's war spending in the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves."}
{"translation": "They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on obligations issued by the Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government."}
{"translation": "Of course, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism."}
{"translation": "To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to their creation."}
{"translation": "These events took place in the generally accepted period of the High Middle Ages \u2013 the period of European history that runs from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300)."}
{"translation": "The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500."}
{"translation": "The technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by a underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies."}
{"translation": "Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself occurs beyond the cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned intrinsically rather than socially."}
{"translation": "For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads."}
{"translation": "However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car."}
{"translation": "The massive possession of cars also leads to an increased incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries."}
{"translation": "Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel."}
{"translation": "According to Romantic theories, geography shaped individuals and, with time, customs and a culture linked to this geography would have emerged. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrary laws."}
{"translation": "In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of contemporary fashion, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe."}
{"translation": "Its reputation as a luxury hub began in the fourth century, and lasted until the eleventh century."}
{"translation": "His status declined during the twelfth century, primarily because Crusaders returned laden with silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could not compete."}
{"translation": "It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris."}
{"translation": "The Gothic style reached its apogee between the 10th and 13th centuries."}
{"translation": "At first, the robe was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east."}
{"translation": "However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western modes could lag by 25 to 30 years."}
{"translation": "During the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothing."}
{"translation": "Subsistence farming is a farming practice that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family."}
{"translation": "Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often biological, using locally preserved seeds, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield."}
{"translation": "Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries."}
{"translation": "Subcultures gather individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity."}
{"translation": "Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and / or gender."}
{"translation": "The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors."}
{"translation": "Members of a subculture often signal their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, manners and slang."}
{"translation": "One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood."}
{"translation": "These children are considered \"ferocious\" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child."}
{"translation": "Wild children might have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing."}
{"translation": "Some would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild."}
{"translation": "When fully raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans."}
{"translation": "While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further."}
{"translation": "Support is not a learning method but rather a means of helping learners who discover a new teaching such as the use of a new program or the beginning of a new project."}
{"translation": "Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone from Microsoft Office is also."}
{"translation": "Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to question, guide and explain procedures that would have been too difficult for the student to manage on their own."}
{"translation": "Children are placed in foster care for very different reasons that range from neglect to abuse, to extortion."}
{"translation": "No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but that's the case."}
{"translation": "We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children."}
{"translation": "Our placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care."}
{"translation": "The placement in foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed."}
{"translation": "The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication."}
{"translation": "The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and gratifications."}
{"translation": "For example, \u201clearning\u201d and \u201csocialization\u201d are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995)."}
{"translation": "\u201c\u2009Personal involvement\u2009\u201d and \u201c\u2009continuous relationships\u2009\u201d were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to internet sites."}
{"translation": "The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial expressions lasting for a few milliseconds."}
{"translation": "It is claimed that one can detect if someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions."}
{"translation": "Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand the speech because of brain injuries are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with precision."}
{"translation": "He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour can be found in domestic animals such as dogs."}
{"translation": "The twentieth century research showed that there are two genetic reservoirs of variation\u00a0: hidden and expressed."}
{"translation": "Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations."}
{"translation": "Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation."}
{"translation": "In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources."}
{"translation": "In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disturbances, malnutrition and ultimately death."}
{"translation": "The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked."}
{"translation": "By contrast, animal food (termites, ants, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids."}
{"translation": "All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" a little bit like the chimpanzees of the savanna do today."}
{"translation": "The interruption of sleep is the process in which you intentionally wake up during your sleep period and fall asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes)."}
{"translation": "It can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you wake up without being completely woken up."}
{"translation": "If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off."}
{"translation": "The other possibilities based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquids before bedtime (especially water or tea, which are considered diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate."}
{"translation": "The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind."}
{"translation": "The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force is. Each person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment."}
{"translation": "Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity."}
{"translation": "Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love mahayana and by many Indian yoga techniques."}
{"translation": "In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the universal love path."}
{"translation": "With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations."}
{"translation": "The center of Tibetan meditation is the practice of the deity. It is through visualizing different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and awakening consciousness created."}
{"translation": "Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended their cooperation."}
{"translation": "Two years after the end of the war, the old allies became enemies and the cold war began."}
{"translation": "It would last for the next 40 years and would see real battles, through proxy armies, on battlefields both in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places."}
{"translation": "On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead."}
{"translation": "But these plans were rendered obsolete almost immediately, when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the east of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral."}
{"translation": "The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans."}
{"translation": "The work of navies traditionally has been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and goods."}
{"translation": "One of the most recent and remarkable examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to make it across the Atlantic to soldiers and equipment to help the British."}
{"translation": "At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-Boats, was trying to stop this traffic."}
{"translation": "If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just as she did for the rest of Europe."}
{"translation": "It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran."}
{"translation": "The ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them close to them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skin."}
{"translation": "Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been in use today."}
{"translation": "The \"wagonways\" were built in England as early as the 16th century."}
{"translation": "Although the tracks for wagons were simply wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day."}
{"translation": "Crossbars were introduced early enough to keep tracks in place. However, it soon became apparent that tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with a strip of iron on top."}
{"translation": "This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on wooden wheels of carriages."}
{"translation": "Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared."}
{"translation": "The first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (\"upright man\")."}
{"translation": "Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual."}
{"translation": "Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs already seven million years ago."}
{"translation": "We can begin by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to mitigate the suffering to come."}
{"translation": "In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and disable them."}
{"translation": "It is clear that the world has changed greatly through the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity."}
{"translation": "After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a manuscript signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few blocks away, to the printing shop of John Dunlap."}
{"translation": "Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as Dunlap Broadsides."}
{"translation": "The first public reading of the document took place at the Independence Hall on July 8."}
{"translation": "One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10."}
{"translation": "The 25 Dunlap leaves still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived."}
{"translation": "Many palaeontologists think today that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds."}
{"translation": "Very few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly."}
{"translation": "But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs."}
{"translation": "They are covered with scales and have claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex."}
{"translation": "Practically all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is coded in binary numbers."}
{"translation": "A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits in computer jargon."}
{"translation": "An internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible."}
{"translation": "The best indicator of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of drugs or household chemicals."}
{"translation": "Consult the label to know the specific first aid instructions for this poison."}
{"translation": "The word \"insect\" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects."}
{"translation": "This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans."}
{"translation": "Reduces, just like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or the habitat of their host."}
{"translation": "In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults."}
{"translation": "Multiple sclerosis is a disease which affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve."}
{"translation": "Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men."}
{"translation": "A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in the interest of the child, to care for a baby."}
{"translation": "These couples can choose to do an adoption project for their baby."}
{"translation": "In the context of adoption, the biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child."}
{"translation": "The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research."}
{"translation": "However, it is not the only one, the experiment, and an experience is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to pose questions and to make observations, but also to direct scientific research."}
{"translation": "Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin."}
{"translation": "Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted."}
{"translation": "With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots."}
{"translation": "Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend often on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks."}
{"translation": "Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals."}
{"translation": "Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation."}
{"translation": "The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material."}
{"translation": "Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium."}
{"translation": "They carried out two experiments to label either the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with a radioactive sulfur."}
{"translation": "Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and if the affected cells are germ cells."}
{"translation": "Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer."}
{"translation": "Ecotourism is the interest of people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora."}
{"translation": "Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities."}
{"translation": "One can, for example, go and see, photograph, and discover orang-utans in Borneo."}
{"translation": "Every morning, people leave the small towns of the countryside in their cars to go to their workplaces and cross other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left."}
{"translation": "In this dynamic transportation shuttle, each is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars and supports it."}
{"translation": "Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years."}
{"translation": "Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems."}
{"translation": "In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges."}
{"translation": "Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?"}
{"translation": "Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically."}
{"translation": "To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) bandwidth, (2) density and (3) speed."}
{"translation": "These relationships help to plan, design, and operate highway facilities."}
{"translation": "Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made them more easily able to escape from their enemies and find more easily food and companions."}
{"translation": "Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings along their bodies."}
{"translation": "It gives them more places to hide from predators."}
{"translation": "Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemera."}
{"translation": "There are a few thousand years ago, a man called Aristarque said that the solar system moves around the Sun."}
{"translation": "Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars)."}
{"translation": "It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, doesn't it?"}
{"translation": "The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second-largest river."}
{"translation": "Amazon is also the largest river in the world, sometimes reaching 10 km wide."}
{"translation": "Not less than 20% of the water that pours from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon."}
{"translation": "The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers."}

{"translation": "The citizens of the Vatican City State are all Roman Catholics."}
{"translation": "Since antiquity, peoples have been familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in their raw form and are relatively simple to mine using primitive tools."}
{"translation": "Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was the earth, water, air and fire."}
{"translation": "It was rather the four states of matter (in the same order)\u00a0: solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also emitted the theory that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see."}
{"translation": "Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many elements."}
{"translation": "Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold."}
{"translation": "There are also alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon."}
{"translation": "Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms."}
{"translation": "The atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence."}
{"translation": "Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out."}
{"translation": "Unfortunately, the appearance of new writing modes has relegated the pen to a more discreet status and to more rare uses."}
{"translation": "People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener."}
{"translation": "One wonders what the keyboard will become when the next new feature arrives."}
{"translation": "The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a myriad of protons and neutrons into a nucleus."}
{"translation": "Like if you were to lift a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the nucleus again, and releasing a little of that energy."}
{"translation": "Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure."}
{"translation": "The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust."}
{"translation": "The crust thickness is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side."}
{"translation": "It is thinner in the seas and thicker on the continents."}
{"translation": "There may be more maria on the side closer because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface."}
{"translation": "Theories of content are centered on the search for what makes people feel good or attractive."}
{"translation": "These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood."}
{"translation": "These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things."}
{"translation": "Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory."}
{"translation": "In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is to try to remain the good friend (or the good friend)."}
{"translation": "This type of manager has a hard time taking unpopular decisions, leading disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable."}
{"translation": "At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things his or her own way."}
{"translation": "After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team."}
{"translation": "This behavior often leads to dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team."}
{"translation": "Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences."}
{"translation": "Virtual team members often function as contact points for their immediate physical group."}
{"translation": "They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership."}
{"translation": "The presence of a real \"hidden\" team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team."}
{"translation": "The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It establishes standards for each of them."}
{"translation": "Why would an organization want to impose the cumbersome process of creating a learning structure\u2009? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation."}
{"translation": "When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can fully express themselves."}
{"translation": "Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client\u2019s need."}
{"translation": "Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create an innovation culture, shared knowledge and its own learning culture."}
{"translation": "Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results."}
{"translation": "Neuro-biological data provide evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore reduce the scope of research and make it much more precise."}
{"translation": "The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research."}
{"translation": "It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain injuries affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions."}
{"translation": "The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before."}
{"translation": "It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds."}
{"translation": "Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science-fiction, it is a very important part of computer science which studies intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptive behaviour of a machine."}
{"translation": "Artificial intelligence research aims at automating by machines tasks requiring intelligent approaches."}
{"translation": "Among the examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and questions of clients, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face."}
{"translation": "These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on the contribution of solutions to everyday problems."}
{"translation": "The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer and video game software."}
{"translation": "Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his or her students to places where a bus trip is not possible."}
{"translation": "The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch ancient objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful artwork while sitting with their class."}
{"translation": "Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share your experiences with future generations."}
{"translation": "For example, students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the capital of the state. Each year, the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album."}
{"translation": "Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having a public audience usually improves the situation."}
{"translation": "As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism."}
{"translation": "In addition, blogging \"obliges students to better understand the world around them\". The need to attract the public's interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)."}
{"translation": "Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day."}
{"translation": "\"When used properly, blogs can allow students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking abilities: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinions with those of others and present their own points of view on specific topics.\""}
